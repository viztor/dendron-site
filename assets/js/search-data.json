Use `Run Extension` from the [[debug pane|dendron.dev.ref.vscode#debug-pane]] (note: this requires that dendron be installed. VSCode might ask you to install Dendron and reload at this point)\n3. Make sure you are inside a Dendron workspace. If not, either initialize one using `Dendron: Initialize Workspace` or change to one using `Dendron: Change Workspace`\n\n## Setup without Dendron Extension Installed\n\nDendron markdown links depends on the dendron extension to be active. You can still make it work without the extension by the following instructions:\n\n1. Comment out the following in `package.json`\n   ```json\n   \"extensionDependencies\": [\n       \"dendron.dendron\"\n   ],\n   ```\n2. Follow step 2 in the setup instructions above.\n3.

with { maxWait } causes the debounced version of `onUpdatePickerItem` to actually act like `_.throttle()`, which then ensured that `onUpdatePickerItem` to fire at least every `maxWait` ms.\n\nThis sounds like what we want, but `onUpdateDebounced` calls were stacking up before the debounced `onUpdatePickerItem` had the chance to return.\n\nThis caused the initial `onUpdatePickerItem` call to be blocked. The first call to it was blocked by the second call, the second blocked by the third, ... and so on.\n\n\n```sh\n# _.debounce(func, 100, { leading: true, maxWait: 200 })\n{ctx: 'onUpdateDebounced'}\n{ctx: 'updatePickerItems', profile: 578} # first debounced call triggers immediately because of `leading`: true\n{ctx: 'onUpdateDebounced'} # all subsequent calls to the debounced updatePickerItem are stacked up here.\n{ctx: 'onUpdateDebounced'} # since maxWait is set, it waited for that amount until it fired another one.\n{ctx: 'onUpdateDebounced'} # with our workspace with +10K notes, the `updatePickerItems` call takes about 520~530ms, so this exceeded the\n{ctx: 'onUpdateDebounced'} # maxWait, firing another one.\n{ctx: 'onUpdateDebounced'}\n{ctx: 'onUpdateDebounced'}\n{ctx: 'onUpdateDebounced'} # until it reached the final call (I typed 8 characters)\n{ctx: 'updatePickerItems', profile: 4045} # This should have not fired if we were actually debouncing.\n{ctx: 'updatePickerItems', profile: 3518} # Notice each of the subsequent `updatePickerItems` took 530ms-ish less milliseconds\n{ctx: 'updatePickerItems', profile: 2995}\n{ctx: 'updatePickerItems', profile: 2471}\n{ctx: 'updatePickerItems', profile: 1945}\n{ctx: 'updatePickerItems', profile: 1422}\n{ctx: 'updatePickerItems', profile: 893}\n```\n\nThis is how it looks like when you remove the `maxWait` option.\n\n```sh\n# _.debounce(func, 100, { leading: true })\n{ctx: 'onUpdateDebounced'}\n{ctx: 'updatePickerItems', profile: 624} # first one triggered immediately because of `leading`: true\n{ctx: 'onUpdateDebounced'}\n{ctx: 'updatePickerItems', profile: 605} # at some point I typed slower than 100ms, so it fired once more.\n{ctx: 'onUpdateDebounced'}\n{ctx: 'updatePickerItems', profile: 560} # last call waited 100ms and then triggered.\n```\n\nWaiting for longer than how long `updatePickerItems` usually takes would prevent this as well.\n```sh\n# _.debounce(func, 700, { leading: true, maxWait: 700 })\n# this is essentially _.throttle(func, 700, { leading: true })\n{ctx: 'onUpdateDebounced'}\n{ctx: 'updatePickerItems', profile: 568} # leading: true fired it immediately\n{ctx: 'onUpdateDebounced'}\n{ctx: 'updatePickerItems', profile: 564} # all subsequent keystroke reset the timer before 700ms, so never triggered until last.\n```\n\nTwo options:\n1. remove `maxWait`\n  - This does not guarantee `updatePickerItems` firing until the user make a sufficient pause, \n  - but need no more tweaking.\n\n2. adjust `wait` as well as `maxWait` (use throttle).\n  - Need constant tweaking, may need some analytics to figure out the sweet spot.\n  - will ensure it fires at least once in a while.\n\nI am leaning towards option 1, but I think it's a good idea to add some analytics on the `updatePickerItems` call duration regardless.\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/Y49ti3zvCqmI6dSajW3MT.html","relUrl":"notes/Y49ti3zvCqmI6dSajW3MT.html"},{"doc":"Commands","title":"Commands","hpath":"pkg.dendron-plugin.t.commands","content":"\n## Summary\n\nVSCode command execution\n\n## Base Command Lifecycle\n\n### Simplified\n\nThis is a simplified sequence diagram of the `BaseCommand` lifecycle.\nNote that the _optional_ flow between `run()` and `enrichInputs()` (marked with a dotted square with _opt_) is actually something that required to be implemented when you extend `BaseCommand` to make a new command.

Add command to `DENDRON_COMMANDS` under `plugin-core/src/constants.ts`\n2. Open the command prompt, enter `Run Task`, and run `gen:config`\n   - this will add the command to `package.json`\n3. Create the new command in `plugin-core/src/commands/{COMMAND_NAME}.ts`\n   - you can copy the contents of an existing command (eg. `src/commands/ShowHelp.ts`) to help you get started\n4. Write tests\n   - tests are in `plugin-core/src/test/suite-integ/{COMMAND}`\n   - testing instructions are [[here|dendron.dev.qa]]\n5. Write command logic\n6. If it makes sense, add a keyboard shortcut for the command. Make sure it doesn't conflict with an generic VSCode command or existing Dendron commands. You can detect existing keybindings by using the guide [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings#_detecting-keybinding-conflicts)\n7. Add command to `src/commands/index.ts`\n8. Submit pull request\n\n\nConventions:\n- if your command involves opening a note, also return it in the `CommandOutput` signature. this makes it easy to compose the command as well as test it\n\n\n## Pods\n\n### Create a new Pod\n\n1. setting up dev environment and getting started: <https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/81da87be-2d4e-47b5-a1d6-c0d647e1ab00.html>\n2. sample code for json export pod: <https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/pods-core/src/builtin/JSONPod.ts>\n3. what you will get from `prepareNotesForExport`: <https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/0db94b86-d5c2-4e70-8f61-1a686fa8cc1d.html>\n4. anki pod: take notes and transform them to anki format\n\n## Config\n\n### Migrating an existing configuration\n\nConfiguration migrations should be done in two phases\n\n#### Phase I - Set new value as default\n1. When migrating to a new configuration, always assume that the new configiuration could be `undefined` sinice migrations can fail \n  - bug in our script, user cancels, etc\n2. Make sure that we can fall back to the old configuration if no new configuration is found\n  - in case the migration doesn't take\n3. When setting the next version, set it to the next **patch** version of whatever is currently released \n  - otherwise, users getting the new patch won't get migrated\n4. Report a metric to see how many users are usiing the old version without the new version present (this number should go to zero)\n\n#### Phase 2 - Remove old vaule\n1. Once the metric in 4 has reached a sufficient threshold, remove the old version\n\n\n### Adding new configuration\n- [example issue](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/613)\n\nSee [[Configuration|pkg.common-all.dev#configuration]]\n\n### Working with VSCode Workspace State\n\nUse the [[State Service|pkg.dendron-plugin.arch.state-service]] when working with VSCode workspace related state.\n\n## Lookup\n\n### Add a new button\n\n1. add type\n   - src/commands/LookupCommand.ts\n   ```ts\n   export type LookupEffectType = \"copyNoteLink\" | \"copyNoteRef\" | \"multiSelect\" | \"insertNote\";\n   ```\n2. add button\n\n```ts\nexport class InsertNoteLinkButton extends DendronBtn {\n  static create(pressed?: boolean) {\n    return new CopyNoteLinkButton({\n      title: \"Insert Note\",\n      iconOff: \"diff-added\",\n      iconOn: \"menu-selection\",\n      type: \"insertNote\" as LookupEffectType,\n      pressed,\n    });\n  }\n\n  async handle({ quickPick }: ButtonHandleOpts) {\n    if (this.pressed) {\n      let items: readonly DNodePropsQuickInputV2[];\n      if (quickPick.canSelectMany) {\n        items = quickPick.selectedItems;\n      } else {\n        items = quickPick.activeItems;\n      }\n      let links = items\n        .filter((ent) => !PickerUtilsV2.isCreateNewNotePick(ent))\n        .map((note) => NoteUtils.createWikiLink({ note }));\n      if (_.isEmpty(links)) {\n        vscode.window.showInformationMessage(`no items selected`);\n      } else {\n        await clipboard.writeText(links.join(\"\\n\"));\n        vscode.window.showInformationMessage(`${links.length} links copied`);\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n### Adding Command with Lookup\n\nPre-requisites:\n- [[Create a new Command|pro.dendron-plugin.cook#create-a-new-command]]\n\nThis goes over adding a new command with lookup. To see an example, see this [command](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/plugin-core/src/commands/InsertNoteLink.ts) and this commit: `cc8a02b4`.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant user\n    participant lookupCommand\n    participant lookupController\n    participant lookupProvider\n    user ->> lookupCommand: user issues command\n    Note left of user: 1. cmd.gatherInput()\n    rect rgb(0, 255, 0)\n      lookupCommand ->> lookupController: creates controller \n      lookupCommand ->> lookupProvider: creates provider\n      lookupCommand ->> lookupController: call show(provider)\n      lookupCommand ->> lookupProvider: subscribe to provider\n      lookupController ->> user: shows quickinput \n    end\n    user ->> user: chooses a selection\n    lookupProvider ->> lookupCommand: notify(selection)\n    lookupCommand ->> lookupCommand: calls command.execute()\n```\n\n1 Gather inputs\n  - this method is responsible for configuring and instantiating the lookup controller and provider\n    - controller controls presentation of the quickinput\n    - provider controls the data retrieval behavior \n    - on success, will return the following [response type](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/plugin-core/src/components/lookup/LookupProviderV3.ts)\n    - NOTE: because we can't simply block on `showQuickInput`, we return a promise that listens to a `lookupProvider` event with the corresponding `id` of the particular command\n\n## UI\n### Adding a Web UI Component\n1. see [[Create a new Command|pro.dendron-plugin.cook#create-a-new-command]] for creating a new command\n1. Add a new entry to [DendronWebViewKey](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/common-all/src/types/typesv2.ts)\n1. in `execute`, create a new webview\n  ```ts\n    const title = //TODO: add panel title\n    const panel = window.createWebviewPanel(\n      \"dendronIframe\", // Identifies the type of the webview. Used internally\n      title, // Title of the panel displayed to the user\n      ViewColumn.One, // Editor column to show the new webview panel in.\n      {\n        enableScripts: true,\n        enableCommandUris: true,\n        enableFindWidget: true,\n        localResourceRoots: [],\n      }\n    );\n    resp = WebViewUtils.genHTMLForWebView({\n        title: \"Dendron Config\",\n        view: DendronWebViewKey[TODO]\n    });\n    panel.webview.html = resp;\n  ```\n\nRelated:\n- See [[here|pkg.dendron-next-server.dev#development]] for how to preview and test your web ui.\n\n\n## Utilities\n\n### Getting DendronEngine\n\n```ts\ngetWS().engine\n```\n\n### Accessing DendronConfig\n\nThere are multiple ways to do this. You should get the config from the workspace instance. \n\n```ts\ngetWs().config\n```\n\n### Clipboard\n\n```ts\nimport { clipboard } from \"../utils\";\nclipboard.writeText(link);\n```\n\n### Check if file is in vault\n- see src/views/DendronTreeViewV2.ts\n\n```ts\n  const uri = editor.document.uri;\n  const basename = path.basename(uri.fsPath);\n  const ws = getWS();\n  if (!ws.workspaceService?.isPathInWorkspace(uri.fsPath)) {\n    return;\n  }\n```\n\n### Insert Text\n- src/commands/InsertNoteCommand.ts\n\n```ts\n  const editor = VSCodeUtils.getActiveTextEditor()!;\n  const pos = editor.selection.active;\n  await editor.edit((builder) => {\n    const selection = new Selection(pos, pos);\n    builder.replace(selection, txt);\n  });\n```\n\n### Prompt User for Input using Selection\n\n- see [this](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/plugin-core/src/commands/VaultAddCommand.ts)\n\n### Prompt User for Input using Free Text\n\n- see [this](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/plugin-core/src/commands/VaultAddCommand.ts)\n\n```ts\nlet out = await VSCodeUtils.showInputBox({\n    prompt: \"Path to your new vault (relative to your workspace root)\",\n    placeHolder: localVaultPathPlaceholder,\n});\nif (PickerUtilsV2.isStringInputEmpty(out)) return;\n```\n\n### Get location of the frontmatter\n\n- example [here](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/plugin-core/src/services/NoteSyncService.ts)\n```\n\n```\n\n## Tests\n\n### Upating the cursor position\n\n- see

uses [`TextEditorDecorationType`](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#TextEditorDecorationType) to render decorations in the editor. See the file [`windowDecorations.ts`](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/plugin-core/src/features/windowDecorations.ts) for examples.\n\n## Adding a new decoration\n\nFirst, edit the `DECORATION_TYPE` object to define the decoration rules for your\nnew decoration. You define any text color, background color etc. at this step.\nAlso make sure to define `rangeBehavior`, VSCode uses this to decide when it's\nokay to simply expand the decorated region when the user is typing.\n\nNext, add a decorator function. See examples like `decorateUserTag` and\n`decorateWikiLink` in the same file. The function should accept a markdown node,\nthen return a list of `DecorationAndType`, which is just a `DECORATION_TYPE` and\nthe decoration options for this node. The decoration options must include the\nrange to be decorated, but can also add per-node decorations to appear before or\nafter the decorated region (see the timestamp decorations, or tags for example).\n\nFinally, add the decorator function to the `DECORATOR` map. Once you're done,\nrun the extension and create a new note to test out your new decoration. Make\nsure to include an example note in your PR too.\n\nTo test your decoration, edit the file `WindowDecorations.test.ts`. The test\nwill roughly look like:\n\n```ts\nconst blockAnchorDecorations = allDecorations!.get(\n  DECORATION_TYPE.blockAnchor\n);\nexpect(blockAnchorDecorations.length).toEqual(1);\nexpect(\n  isTextDecorated(\"^anchor-1\", blockAnchorDecorations!, document)\n).toBeTruthy();\n```\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/74UyCLyLvCxFTQNgGgSRW.html","relUrl":"notes/74UyCLyLvCxFTQNgGgSRW.html"},{"doc":"Changelog","title":"Changelog","hpath":"pkg.dendron-plugin.changelog","content":"\n- 2021.06.29: [fix: horizontal line folded as frontmatter by SeriousBug](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/pull/886/files)\n\n### 2021.06.27\n- [Fix contentHas is undefined by kevinslin · Pull Request #880 · dendronhq/dendron](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/pull/880)\n\n## Old\n- [fix: updated time should only change if note content changes by kevinslin · Pull Request #854 · dendronhq/dendron](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/pull/854)","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/QtTB_2Lzo6PTVFuw63mD1.html","relUrl":"notes/QtTB_2Lzo6PTVFuw63mD1.html"},{"doc":"Arch","title":"Arch","hpath":"pkg.dendron-plugin.arch","content":"\n## Summary\n\nDescribes how various parts of Dendron Work\n\n## Index\n- [[Commands|pkg.dendron-plugin.t.commands]]\n\n## Other\n### FileWatcher\n\nModify engine state in response to files changing\n\n- NOTE: this is called `VaultWatcher`\n\n#### onDidChange\n- updates note links\n- updates note anchors\n\n\n### WindowWatcher\n\nModify UI in response to active note\n\n#### onDidChangeActive\n\n- triggerUpdateDecorations\n- triggerNoteGraphViewUpdate\n- triggerSchemaGraphViewUpdate","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/d1usLHSTfJc-3_JKuYLBr.html","relUrl":"notes/d1usLHSTfJc-3_JKuYLBr.html"},{"doc":"State Service","title":"State Service","hpath":"pkg.dendron-plugin.arch.state-service","content":"\n\n## Summary\n- path: plugin-core/src/services/stateService.ts\n\n\n```ts\n/**\n * Keeps track of workspace state.

The instructions below cover using `dendron/test-workspace` which is already pre-configured to use a local nextjs setup.\n1. Initialize test-workspace\n  ```sh\n  cd dendron/test-workspace\n  ./scripts/dev.sh\n  ```\n1. In a separate terminal, start the Next Server\n  ```sh\n  cd dendron/packages/dendron-next-server\n  yarn dev\n  ```\n1. (optional) To connect to the workspace using chrome, enter the following in your localhost (replace WORKSPACE and PORT with your own values) ^MgEdJdyD\n   ```sh\n   # for example, if you launched the engine at /user/adam/workspace, WORKSPACE should equal /user/adam/workspace\n   http://localhost:3000/vscode/sample?ws=$WORKSPACE&port=$PORT&browser=1\n   ```\n1. To test the UI with the plugin, see instructions to [[run the extension|dendron.dev.debug]]. When running, make sure to use `test-workspace` to access the UI\n\nNext Steps:\n- read the [[architecture|pkg.dendron-next-server.arch]] documents to understand how the next server fits in with other Dendron plugins and how to build on top of it\n\n### PR Checklist\n- see [[Pull Request|dendron.dev.pull-request]]\n- [ ] make sure your UI is compatible with light/dark theme \n\n\n## Issues\n\n### Conflicting Views\n- if you have conflicting views warning when debugging, its most likely because you've installed Dendron in the same version of VSCode that you are developing on.

Modify the theme values in `dendron-next-server/assets/themes/*`\n1. Run `yarn gen:theme`\n1. To preview you theme, start the server and navigate to `/vscode/sample` \n\n- Instructions for updating the theme were originally obtained from [this guide](https://dev.to/joserfelix/dynamic-theme-switching-in-ant-design-how-to-change-between-light-and-dark-themes-5b8p)\n\n### Integrating a view with the plugin\n- see [here](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/plugin-core/src/commands/ConfigureWithUI.ts#L22:L22) for integrating a command with the web ui\n\n### Integrating a tree view with the plugin\n- see [here](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/plugin-core/src/views/DendronTreeViewV2.ts) for an example\n\n\n### Adding a VSCode Webview\n- webview naming should follow kebab case\n```ts\n// good\ntree-view.tsx\n\n//bad\ntreeView.tsx\n```\n\n\n### Send a message\n\nPassing messages to the webview\n\n```js\nmsg = {\n    \"type\": \"onDidChangeActiveTextEditor\",\n    \"data\": {\n        \"note\": {\n            \"id\": \"70486100-ab5e-434e-bbb7-af8543c66241\",\n            \"title\": \"One\",\n            \"vault\": {\n                \"fsPath\": \"vault\"\n            },\n            \"type\": \"note\",\n            \"desc\": \"\",\n            \"links\": [],\n            \"fname\": \"bond.one\",\n            \"updated\": 1621464283051,\n            \"created\": 1621464283051,\n            \"parent\": \"b458d57f-dd08-4d2e-bda1-cdb883f40bf3\",\n            \"children\": [],\n            \"data\": {},\n            \"custom\": {},\n            \"body\": \"\\n\"\n        },\n        \"sync\": true\n    },\n    \"source\": \"vscode\"\n};\nwindow.postMessage(msg, \"*\");\n```\n\n### Find a specific view\n\n- see [[Overflow|scratch.2021.05.21.121558.scrollbar]]\n\nLook for the following html in the webview debugger.\n\n```html\n<div id=\"webview-webviewview-dendron-tree-view\" data-keybinding-context=\"30\" style=\"visibility: visible; position: absolute; overflow: hidden; top: 405px; left: 48px; width: 305px; height: 353px;\"><iframe class=\"webview ready\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-downloads\" allow=\"clipboard-read; clipboard-write;\" src=\"vscode-webview://webviewview-dendron-tree-view/index.html?id=webviewview-dendron-tree-view&amp;extensionId=&amp;purpose=undefined&amp;serviceWorkerFetchIgnoreSubdomain=undefined&amp;platform=electron&amp;vscode-resource-origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwebviewview-dendron-tree-view.vscode-webview-test.com\" style=\"border: none; width: 100%; height: 100%;\"></iframe></div>\n```\n\n### Using a custom workspace\n\n1. Modify the `dendron.yml` of the workspace you want to use\n   ```yml\n   dev:\n     # use CLI based engine instead of creating a new one\n     engineServerPort: 3005\n     # for UI components, proxy to next server instead of creating our own\n     nextServerUrl: http://localhost:3000\n   ```\n2. Launch the workspace\n   ```sh\n   # engine port\n   PORT=3005\n   # absolute path to your workspace root\n   WORKSPACE={path/to/workspace}\n   cd $WORKSPACE\n   env LOG_LEVEL=info dendron launchEngineServer --init --port $PORT\n   ```\n3. Connect to the workspace (replace WORKSPACE and PORT with your own values)\n   ```\n   # for example, if you launched the engine at /user/adam/workspace, WORKSPACE should equal /user/adam/workspace\n   http://localhost:3000/vscode/sample?ws=$WORKSPACE&port=$PORT\n   ```\n\n### Use Redux Dev Tools\n\nThe developer tools inside VSCode is limited. If you want to use all the power of chrome when debugging, you'll want to visit the webview using chrome.\n\nSee [[instructions|pkg.dendron-next-server.dev#^MgEdJdyD]] for connecting to a workspace using the browser\n\n\n### Passing Query Parameters\n\n- [generating query params](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/dendron-next-server/pages/vscode/note-preview.tsx)\n- [Consuming query params in the view](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/dendron-next-server/pages/vscode/note-preview.tsx)","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/1698aef0-efd4-4c92-a3b0-5ca702b228a3.html","relUrl":"notes/1698aef0-efd4-4c92-a3b0-5ca702b228a3.html"},{"doc":"Arch","title":"Arch","hpath":"pkg.dendron-next-server.arch","content":"\n## Summary\n\nThe next server contains the UI components for the Dendron Plugin, the Dendron Preview, and the Dendron published site.\n\n## Details\nAll plugin related code gets routed to the `/vscode` path which is set in `_app.tsx`. \n\nWhen building the plugin, all `/vscode` pages will be exported as static files and bundled with the plugin extension. They will be served at runtime using `expressjs`.\n\nThere are two kind of views in the plugin that get handled by NextJs:\n- webviews\n- treeviews\n\nTreeviews are components in the sidepanel, webviews are views that are revealed using a command (eg. `Dendron: Configure`). The mechanism of rendering both views are similar.\n\n\n## Components\n\n## LifeCycle\n\n### Startup\n1. User initiates the view by opening the tree view or issuing the UI command\n1. This brings up a webview with the following [code](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/plugin-core/src/views/utils.ts)\n    ```html\n    <html> \n    ...\n    <iframe id=\"iframeView\" src=\"${src}\"></iframe>\n    </html>\n    ```\n1. The `src` is set to be a corresponding page in `/vscode`. We also pass along [[Dendron Engine|pkg.dendron-engine]] parameters as querystrings.\n1. Express will load up the nextjs view as a static asset and it will be rendered inside VSCode using the iframe.\n1. During initialization, the view will connect to the `engine` and hydrate its `redux` store with current notes and IDE related properties (eg. current notes)\n    - the aforementioned properties are passed down to all child component as [props](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/dendron-next-server/pages/_app.tsx)\n\nWhen the view needs to interact with VSCode, it does so by passing messages. We wrote a helper utility that takes care of this, you can see an example of it [here](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/dendron-next-server/pages/vscode/tree-view.tsx)\n\nYou can see an example of an UI event propagating back to VSCode [[here|pkg.dendron-next-server.internal#onclick]]\n\n\n# Etc\n\n## Dendron Preview \n- codename: Unified Preview\n- status: [[Planning 🗺️|dendron.ref.status#planning-️]]\n\nThe Dendron Preview should be just one particular view in of `nextjs` that is served when using the Dendron Plugin. There are a few special requirements for the preview that aren't there for other views which is why this gets its own section. Specifically, the preview view should support the following features:\n\n- scroll sync: a user scrolling through the raw markdown of the current preview should have the preview scroll in sync with the text and vice versa\n\n### Details\nInitial note render, render note using passed in `noteId` via `queryParam.\n\nAs long as the current webview is not closed, changing the active window will cause a message to the webview to update the display. \n\n### Images\nTo display an image, the [dendronPreview](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/dev/packages/engine-server/src/markdown/remark/dendronPreview.ts) plugin will convert image links to links that call `assetGet` API from the [[pkg.dendron-api-server]]\n\nThis is necessary because static images are contained within the vault whereas image links by default are relative to where the static file is being served (eg. `~/.code/extensions/...`). In addition, whereas both nextjs and expressjs have capabilities to render static assets, there isn't a straightforward way to add static routes dynamically. \n\nSo instead of using static assets, we are dynamically fetching the assets instead.  The preview displays images by rewriting `/assets/img1.jpg` to `localhost:{port}/api/assetGet?fpath=...ws=...` We pass in the current workspace to make sure that the static file you are retrieving comes from inside a valid active workspace. \n\n## Dendron Published Site\n- codename: NEXT Publishing \n- status: [[Planning 🗺️|dendron.ref.status#planning-️]]\n\nThe Dendron Published Site will be the default path published using nextjs. It has the following requirements:\n\n- support building and publishing using both SSR and simple static deployments\n    - main consideration is the table of contents on the left hand side\n        - it becomes prohibitively big past a few thousand notes to generate this statically for every page\n        - our current process\n            - generate it once during compile time\n            - load it asynchronously using javascript when rending a page\n            - use javascript to open it to the correct location\n        - process for nextjs\n            - we could do the same thing, only issue is that there's a slight pop as we fetch the nav asynchronously\n            - don't want to block on it - for SEO, we want a fully formed HTML document with all content \n            - we can do SSR for folks that opt it to managed hosting to avoid the pop in\n- rendering a note should share code with [[Dendron Preview|pro.dendron-next-server.arch#dendron-preview]] for as much as possible\n    - currently there are some considerations that only apply to published istes\n        - links and references to unpublished pages (we currently generate a custom splash page when a published note links to an unpublished note)\n    - table of contents \n        - the preview relies on vscode tree view components for this, the site needs to generate its own\n    - etc\n\n## Copy and Paste\n\nBy default, modifier controls like copy and paste are disabled because we are operating an iframe operating inside a webview. The workaround is described [here](https://github.com/jevakallio/vscode-live-frame#command-key-combinations-copy-paste-select-all-are-disabled). We've implemented it [here](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/plugin-core/src/views/utils.ts) so that any webview that uses `WebViewUtils` to generate the HTML will come with the workaround. Make sure that keyboard events are allowed to propagate for this workaround to work.

The implementation, representation and the user mental model as the zoom analogy\n  * If you don't realize this you will get confused and frustrated.\n  * We realized also that we worked it out bottom-up and not top-down also observing that we mostly work bottom-up.\n    + Generally we can travers these dimensions/languages from either direction but to materialize them a bottom-up approach seems to be a good default.\n  * Complicated code is a good sign your mental model is wrong\n    + complication is reduced by the right concept, mental model, metapher\n  * sources to read about this\n    + https://pointjupiter.com/ux-mental-model-representation-implementation-user-experience-development/\n    + https://hbr.org/2005/04/how-strategists-really-think-tapping-the-power-of-analogy\n  * Conclusions we made based on that:\n    + active month note `2021.07` should not have an active highlight in montly calendar view \n      + zooming in (month to day when month is active) should not change the active note\n    + open a new calendar entry to the right and not replace it\n      + allows the user to easily switch between already opened entries\n    + show monthly mode when montly entry is active\n      + adjusting the zoom to the appropriate level\n    + meaning tabs lead calendar; calendar only leads when clicking on a field\n      + user action determines behavior\n      + mode switching is a kind of zooming\n    + Inconsitencies\n      + antd Calender does show current day but not current month\n    + issues\n      + calendar reload on every day change (stopped to happen now..)\n      + when `Calendar`'s prop `value` is `null`, which has the purpose to have no active/assigned/highlighted day, causes an error when switching months from the header\n        + This might be the reason why official `null` is not supported. But then how can I tell the antd's `Calendar` to not hightlight a day?\n      + I came across a failure within `getMaybeDatePortion` where it was called with `journalName` being `undefined`.\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/AoaqCwCQfZyPWW4e.html","relUrl":"notes/AoaqCwCQfZyPWW4e.html"},{"doc":"Dendron Markdown","title":"Dendron

Every plugin can be composed of the following three components:\n- parser: classify tokens and attach metadata to tokens\n- transformer: transform the entire syntax tree\n- compiler: change token to output format\n\nUnified gives a few ways of working with processors:\n- `parse`: calls the `parser` and results in an abstract syntax tree\n- `process`: calls `parser`, `transformer`, and `compiler` and usually results in a string output\n\n\n## Components\n\n### Processor\nDendron has different processors depending on the desired output (eg. markdown vs HTML). Below is the interface for markdown\n\n- source: [procRemarkFull](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/51633edcd0817c9b4aa18ff25f492f7a00e6e088/packages/engine-server/src/markdown/utilsv5.ts#L344-L344)\n```ts\nstatic procRemarkFull(\n  data: ProcDataFullOptsV5,\n  opts?: { mode?: ProcMode; flavor?: ProcFlavor }\n) \n```\n\nEach processor takes the following arguments\n- ProcMode\n- ProcFlavor\n- ProcData\n\n- NOTE: disregard the `V5` suffix, this is an artifact of our current migration to the new processor architecture and will be removed in future versions\n\n#### ProcMode\n```ts\n/**\n * What mode a processor should run in\n */\nexport enum ProcMode {\n  /**\n   * Expect no properties from {@link ProcDataFullV5} when running the processor\n   */\n  NO_DATA = \"NO_DATA\",\n  /**\n   * Expect all properties from {@link ProcDataFullV5} when running the processor\n   */\n  FULL = \"all data\",\n  /**\n   * Running processor in import mode.

If you are writing a custom plugin, use the transformer, `dendronPub` (https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/engine-server/src/markdown/remark/dendronPub.ts), which runs after parsing but before compilation to transform the remark nodes into rehype nodes. \n\nYou can see [[Writing a custom Dendron Unified Plugin|pkg.dendron-markdown.cook#writing-a-custom-dendron-unified-plugin]] for more details on this\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/dc72e684-8ff8-4c41-a2f7-93fc14ee0d6a.html","relUrl":"notes/dc72e684-8ff8-4c41-a2f7-93fc14ee0d6a.html"},{"doc":"Dendron Markdown Links","title":"Dendron Markdown Links","hpath":"pkg.dendron-markdown-links","content":"\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/9af9cf56-d2a0-47d1-b8bf-5a02c42ac2fd.html","relUrl":"notes/9af9cf56-d2a0-47d1-b8bf-5a02c42ac2fd.html"},{"doc":"Dendron Jekyll","title":"Dendron Jekyll","hpath":"pkg.dendron-jekyll","content":"This is the Jekyll theme used by Dendron.

[DEngine](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/common-all/src/types/typesv2.ts)\n\n- implementation:\n   - [Store](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/dev/packages/engine-server/src/drivers/file/storev2.ts#L1:L1): engine methods usually operate on the storage layer (eg. write to disk, read from disk) and so store methods often need to be updated\n   - [Engine](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/dev/packages/engine-server/src/enginev2.ts#L68:L68): actual engine implementation\n   - [DendronApi](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/dev/packages/common-all/src/api.ts#L264:L264): used by engine client to call the express server \n   - [API Server Routes](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/tree/master/packages/api-server/src/routes): where the server handles the call from engine client\n   - [DendronEngineClient](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/engine-server/src/engineClient.ts#L55): Implements the call from engine client to API\n   - [DEngineClient](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/dev/packages/engine-server/src/engineClient.ts#L55:L55): wrapper around `DendronAPI` that mirrors the `Engine` API\n\n#### Tune Search Results\n\n1. checkout fuse.js from <https://github.com/krisk/fuse>\n2. install dependencies \n   ```bash\n   npm install\n   ```\n3. build the docs\n   ```bash\n   npm run docs:dev\n   ```\n4. modify `docs/.vuepress/components/Demo/Demo.vue`\n\n   - example of setting custom parameters\n\n   ```js\n   let codify = (pattern) => {\n   return `const options = {\n       shouldSort: true,\n       threshold: 0.6,\n       location: 0,\n       distance: 50,\n       maxPatternLength: 32,\n       minMatchCharLength: 2,\n       useExtendedSearch: true,\n       includeScore: true,\n   keys: [\n       \"title\",\n   ]\n   };\n\n   const fuse = new Fuse(list, options);\n\n   // Change the pattern\n   const pattern = \"${pattern}\"\n\n   return fuse.search(pattern)`\n   }\n   ```\n\n## Lookup\n#scope.lookup\n\n### Connecting to the engine\n\n```ts\nimport { DEngineClientV2, EngineConnector } from \"@dendronhq/engine-server\";\n\nlet dendronEngine: DEngineClientV2;\nconst connector = EngineConnector.instance();\nif (_.isUndefined(connector._engine)) {\n    return vscode.window.showInformationMessage(\n    \"Still initializing. Please close this window and try again after Dendron has been initialized\",\n    );\n}\ndendronEngine = connector.engine;\nif (!engine) {\n    engine = this.initMarkdownEngine({ sourceUri, dendronEngine });\n}\n```\n\n### Querying notes by ID\n\n- [type definitions](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/common-all/src/types/typesv2.ts)\n\n```ts\n\nengine.queryNote\n\n```\n\n### Query notes by file name\n\n- note: make sure that the engine is initialized\n\n- with vault\n\n```ts\nimport {NoteUtilsV2} from \"@dendronhq/engine-server\";\n\nconst maybeNode = NoteUtilsV2.getNoteByFnameV4({\n    fname: dirname,\n    notes: nodes,\n    vault,\n});\n```\n\n- without vault (gets all notes with this name)\n\n```ts\nimport {NoteUtilsV2} from \"@dendronhq/engine-server\";\n\nconst maybeNode = NoteUtilsV2.getNotesByFname({({\n    fname: dirname,\n    notes: nodes,\n});\n```\n\n\n## Markdown\n#scope.markdown\n\n### Adding a new unified plugin\n\n<!-- - [pr example](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/pull/260)  -->\n\n<!-- ea648849f94528d8000a31fd8b89ca8c89de2598 -->\n\nResources:\n\n- [video of pairing session](https://youtu.be/mHkx17akuCg)\n- [commit from pairing session](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/ea648849f94528d8000a31fd8b89ca8c89de2598)\n\nContext:\n\n- Dendron uses [remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark) and [rehype](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype) to handle markdown and html transformations\n- Dendron uses a series of [processors](https://github.com/unifiedjs/unified#processor) to group unified plugins \n- Dendron currently compiles markdown into output formats listed [here](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/engine-server/src/markdown/types.ts#L28:L28)\n\nSteps:\n\n1. add the plugin to engine-server\n   - NOTE: we are still using remark12 so make sure to install the remark12 compatible version of the plugin\n   - instructions to add new packages [[here|dendron.dev.cook#install-a-new-package]]\n2. update `src/markdown/utils.ts` in engine-server\n   - import plugin and add it to the appropriate processor (most likely `procFull`)\n3. write a test for the plugin. plugin tests are located in `engine-test-utils/src/__tests__/engine-server/markdown/`\n   - example [here](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/engine-test-utils/src/__tests__/engine-server/markdown/container.spec.ts)\n   - `createProcTests` is a special function that sets up a Dendron workspace and can help you run a unified processor for multiple output formats\n   - your test should cover every output format that your plugin affects\n   - best way to understand is by example, see the other tests in the same folder for additional examples of how to use this function\n4. write the plugin implementation\n5. make sure your tests pass\n   - its helpful to use the `matchSnapshot` functionality that jest provides\n     if you use the `checkVFile` helper function, this happens automatically\n   - you can view snapshots in `__snapshots__/` folder which is relative to the test\n6. add a flag in `DendronConfig` to toggle the plugin\n   - by default, new plugins are opt-in\n   - if the plugin only affects HTML output, you can put the option in `DendronSiteConfig`\n7. go back into `src/markdown/utils.ts` and use the newly created config value\n   - pass it in as an optional param in `proc*`\n   - conditionally add plugin in config is present\n8. add a test that makes sure the plugin doesn't take into affect if the config is not enabled \n\nNotes on testing:\n\n- when testing `transformers`, `process` will run over the node that is passed in to the processor\n- when testing `parsers` and `compilers`, `process` will run over the text that you pass into it \n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/1bce1c33-c14b-4e5e-b493-45683c8cf54f.html","relUrl":"notes/1bce1c33-c14b-4e5e-b493-45683c8cf54f.html"},{"doc":"Dendron Engine Architecture","title":"Dendron Engine Architecture","hpath":"pkg.dendron-engine.arch","content":"\n\n## Initialization\n\nDendron initialization process\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant client\n    participant engine\n    participant store\n    participant fileSystem\n    participant noteParser\n    client->>engine: initialize\n    engine->>store: initialize\n    store->>fileSystem: fetchAllnotes\n    fileSystem->>store: sendNotes;\n    store->>noteParser: parseAllNotes\n    noteParser->>store: parsedNotes\n    store->>engine: return status\n    engine->>client: return status\n```\n\n- [Video walkthrough](https://youtu.be/nWJCP1DR5Io)\n\n\n## Related\n- [[Dendron Startup|pkg.dendron-engine.internal.startup]]\n- [[Lookup|pkg.dendron-engine.t.lookup]]\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/ebf58a4a-18f8-498d-95eb-04d856c0a000.html","relUrl":"notes/ebf58a4a-18f8-498d-95eb-04d856c0a000.html"},{"doc":"Unified","title":"Unified","hpath":"pkg.dendron-engine.arch.unified","content":"\n## Summary\nSee [[Dendron Markdown|pkg.dendron-markdown]]\n\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/UOvhhWXPOttmb2af.html","relUrl":"notes/UOvhhWXPOttmb2af.html"},{"doc":"Seed","title":"Seed","hpath":"pkg.dendron-engine.arch.seed","content":"\n## Summary\n\nThis goes over seeds\n\n## Adding a seed\n\n\n```ts\nid = registry.get(id)\nseedService.addSeed(id, seed)\n```\n\n- file: src/seed/service.ts\n```ts\nSeedService.addSeed(id, seed) {\n\t@addSeedMetadata {\n\t\tconfig.seeds[id] = seed\n\t\tconfig.vaults.add(seed)\n\t}\n}\n```","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/JE3t4O3SrKwTCCnWRhsL2.html","relUrl":"notes/JE3t4O3SrKwTCCnWRhsL2.html"},{"doc":"History Service","title":"History Service","hpath":"pkg.dendron-engine.arch.history-service","content":"\n## Summary\nThe history service keeps track of lifecycle events in Dendron.

Like most such tools,  Dendron supports all the usual features you would expect like tagging, backlinks, a graph view, split panes, and so forth. But it doesn't stop there - whereas most tools (try to make it) easy to **get notes in**, they tend to make it **hard to get them back out** later, and it only **gets worse as you add more notes**. Dendron helps you **get notes back out** and **works better** the **more notes you have**.\n\nI originally created Dendron because I'd accumulated over **20k notes** on programming and various other topics and couldn't find a tool that would let me easily add and find notes from within my knowledge base. \n\nTraditional note-taking tools are often **too rigid** by having an in-flexible hierarchy that doesn't let you file a note in multiple places. Newer tools are **too flexible** by eschewing hierarchies altogether in favour of relying solely on backlinks. \n\nDendron finds the **usable center** between the two extremes by supporting backlinks of any two arbitrary notes while also maintaining a **canonical hierarchy** for every note. We do this through our **[hierarchal first approach to note taking](https://www.kevinslin.com/notes/3dd58f62-fee5-4f93-b9f1-b0f0f59a9b64.html)** that relies on the combination of [[hierarchies|dendron.topic.hierarchies]], [[schemas|dendron.topic.schema]], and [[path based lookups|dendron.topic.lookup]]. \n\n\nWith Dendron, you can **create, find, and collaborate** on information that **matters to you**.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/graph-intro.gif)\n\n## Use Cases\n\nWhether you organize your notes with [PARA](https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/) or [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/), link notes together like [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/), or simply create notes in an ad-hoc manner, Dendron can help.\n\nThink of it as a [second brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/) to help you **make sense** of all the information you care about.\n\nSome popular use cases include:\n\n- project management \n- learning & academia\n- personal knowledge base \n- journaling of all forms\n- CRM to keep track of clients, friends and enemies\n- {Your Use Case Here}\n\n## Getting Started\n![[dendron.guides.install]]\n\n## Onboarding\n\n[Kevin](https://kevinslin.com/), the founder of Dendron, does a personal onboarding with new users.

[The development of these tools, which] will give society access to and command over the inherited knowledge of the ages [should] be the first objective of our scientist\" - Vannevar Bush, 1945\n\n## You Are Here\n\nThis project is about 1% complete, both in the sense that it is in **preview** but also that there's so much more to build. The north star of this project is to achieve _Vannevar Bush's_ original vision - to build a tool of thought that can give humanity _\"**access to** and **command over** the inherited **knowledge of the ages**\"_.\n\nIf you are reading this, you too, are now part of the journey.

A checked checkbox is rendered for lines starting with `- [x]`.

Below are three different workflows to delineate todo state. \n\n### Inside the Checkbox\n\n- put state in checkbox\n- note that custom checkbox states such as `[w]` are displayed as plain text in markdown previews.

Dendron is the greek word for tree. It's a reference to the hierarchal note taking that Dendron(3) enables. \n2. Dendron is another word for [dendrite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrite) which is an extension of the nerve cell that sends and receives signals in the brain. Think of Dendron(3) as a digital nervous system that helps you consolidate all the information that you care about in the fastest and most efficient way possible.\n3. Dendron is a local-first, markdown based, hierarchical note taking tool. It is meant to help you build, organize, and share knowledge bases of any size.\n\n## How do I get started?\n\n1. Launch the _command palette_ inside vscode:\n   - Linux: `Ctrl+Shift+P`\n   - macOS: `Cmd+Shift+P`\n   - Windows: `Ctrl+Shift+P`\n2. Paste the following command and press `Enter`:\n\n```bash\n> Dendron: Initialize Workspace\n```\n\n![Initialize workspace](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/dendron-init.gif)\n\nWhen the workspace opens, it will show dialogue to install the recommended extensions.

[[Learn the basics of the Dendron UI |dendron.tutorial.navigation-basics]]\n\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/678c77d9-ef2c-4537-97b5-64556d6337f1.html","relUrl":"notes/678c77d9-ef2c-4537-97b5-64556d6337f1.html"},{"doc":"Taking Notes","title":"Taking Notes","hpath":"dendron.tutorial.taking-notes","content":"\n### Create a Note\n\nTo create a note, use `Ctrl+L` / `Cmd+L` to bring up Dendron's lookup. This is a shortcut for the `Dendron: Lookup` command.\n\n> 💡 The lookup command is the main way to interact with Dendron. It is used for both looking up your notes and creating new notes. When you do a lookup on a note that hasn't been created, Dendron will create it for you. Remember the `Ctrl+L` / `Cmd+L` shortcut.\n\n> 🌱 Try it yourself - bring up the lookup bar with `Ctrl+L` / `Cmd+L`. Type `recipes` and hit Enter. Afterward, you can use the `Ctrl+Tab` / `Cmd+Tab` shortcut to get back to the previous note.\n\nThis should have created a note named `recipes.md`. Notes in Dendron are just plaintext markdown. They live in your file system and are portable across any platform, which makes it very easy to import/ export your notes and even to publish your notes to a hosted website. You can try to add some content to the body of your `recipes` note now.\n\nThe --- section at the top of each note is frontmatter. Frontmatter are custom attributes at the top of each markdown file. Dendron uses it to store metadata about each note for features like publishing. Don't modify the id attribute on the front matter.\n\n### Creating a hierarchy\n\nDendron uses flexible hierarchies to help you organize your notes. It's how people are able to manage tens of thousands of notes inside Dendron.\n\n> 🌱 To create a hierarchy, bring up lookup again `(Ctrl+L / Cmd+L)`. Type `recipes.vegetarian` and then press enter.\n\nYou have now created your first hierarchy. Hierarchies in Dendron are created by having a `.` delimiter in the file name. Take a look at the tree view in the side panel to see that the `vegetarian` note exists under the `recipes` hierarchy. You can also see in the Workspace panel that the note file is stored as `recipes.vegetarian.md`.\n\nYou can create a hierarchy at any level:\n\n> 🌱 Type the following into lookup and hit enter: `recipes.italian.desserts.tiramisu`\n\nYou'll notice in the tree view that there is now a `+` sign next to `italian` and `desserts`. The plus sign indicates that this note is a stub. A stub is a placeholder for a note that hasn't actually been created. Dendron uses stubs to avoid cluttering your file system with empty notes when creating hierarchies.\n\n![Tree View](https://org-dendron-public-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images/tutorial-tree-view.png)\n\nFollowing this recipes example, you can try creating other notes that might be relevant. Some examples: `recipes.italian.appetizers`, `recipes.chinese`, `recipes.chinese.appetizers`, `recipes.ingredients.favorites`, `recipes.ingredients.shopping-list`. Hierarchies are flexible, and you can create them in whichever way works best for you. Dendron allows you to easily change the hierarchies later if you change your mind on how to organize your notes.\n\n### Finding Notes\n\nTo find notes, we use the same lookup interface that we used to create them.\n\n> 🌱 Open Lookup, and type `vege`. This will find your `recipes.vegetarian` note. Hit `Enter` to open that note.\n\nThe lookup uses fuzzy search which means you can type out partial results and still see the results. Searching with * wildcards is also supported.\n\nWhen combined with hierarchies, this fast lookup system enables you to find your notes very quickly, even if you have thousands of notes in your vaults.\n\nIf you want to search for content within the notes, you can use VS Code's built-in search tools with `%KEYBINDING%+Shift+F`.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n- Tutorial Step 3: [[Linking Notes|dendron.tutorial.linking-notes]]\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/4RFQMNA91cRW12VJl_PFd.html","relUrl":"notes/4RFQMNA91cRW12VJl_PFd.html"},{"doc":"Rich Formatting","title":"Rich Formatting","hpath":"dendron.tutorial.rich-formatting","content":"\nDendron supports an extended Markdown syntax, which provides a lot of options for rich formatting.

In the editor pane, you can move the cursor into the link and hit `Ctrl+Enter / Cmd+Enter`.\n\nYou can switch back to the previous note by pressing `Ctrl+Tab / Cmd+Tab`\n\n#### Backlinks\n\nTake a look at the backlinks panel on the bottom left section of your sidebar. The backlinks panel shows you all notes that have linked to the current note. This is useful for helping to establish context.\n\n![Backlinks](https://org-dendron-public-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images/tutorial-backlinks.png)\n\n### Explore Your Knowledge Graph\n\n> 🌱 To get a visual representation of your notes, use the `Dendron: Show Note Graph` command.\n\nYou can explore the hierarchical organization of your notes and how your notes are linked together. We're continually working to improve this feature so keep on the lookout for new capabilities in the graph view in the future!\n\n![Graph View](https://org-dendron-public-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images/tutorial-graph-view.png)\n\n### Next Steps\n\n- Tutorial Step 4: [[Rich Formatting|dendron.tutorial.rich-formatting]]\n- Try out some additional features of links:\n  - Create a note directly from a link - place your cursor inside this link `[[recipes.new-recipes-to-try]]`, hit `Ctrl+Enter/Cmd+Enter`.\n  - Add an alias to a link to change how it shows in the preview. Example: [[My Alias|tutorial]]\n  - Relative Links - Link to a specific section of a page with a `#` suffix. Example: [[Additional Link Features|tutorial.3-links-and-graphs#additional-link-features]]\n  - [[Note References|dendron.topic.references]] - Add a section from another note with its content embedded into the current note.\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/9MZBqhrijEM4QpZRa5t08.html","relUrl":"notes/9MZBqhrijEM4QpZRa5t08.html"},{"doc":"Conclusion","title":"Conclusion","hpath":"dendron.tutorial.conclusion","content":"\n**Congratulations!** You've completed the Dendron Tutorial 🙌.

In order to enable link candidates, add the following configuration in `dendron.yml`:\n\n```yaml\ndev:\n  enableLinkCandidates: true\n```\n\n### Common components\nThe view is structured to display information about backlinks as a tree.\n\nWhen you first open the Backlinks view, you will be able to see a list of different notes. These are notes that have at least one backlink to the current note.\n\nEach of the item in the list will have an arrow on the left. If you click on the arrow, the item will expand to display what type of backlinks are in that note.\n\nYou will be able to see an item labeled `Linked` or `Candidates` depending on what type of backlinks that note has to the current note. See the sections below for more information on each item.\n\nIf you click on an item anywhere other than the arrow, it will open that note in your editor.\n\n\n#### Linked backlinks\nIf your current note has a linked backlink to it, you can see them in a subtree labeled `Linked` after expanding each source item.\n\nEach `Linked` backlink will have a label that contains the text that comes before the link to give you a rough context of how the link was used in that location.\n\nClicking on a linked item will open the note that contains the link.\n\n#### Candidate backlinks\nIf your current note has link candidates, you can see them in a subtree labeled `Candidates` after expanding each source item.\n\nEach `Candidate` backlink will have a label that contains the text that comes before the link candidate to give you a rough context of how it was used in that location.\n\nClicking on a link candidate item will open the note that contains the candidate, and convert the link candidate into a wikilink, turning it into `Linked` backlink.)\n\n## Dendron Calendar View\n![[dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.ref.web-ui#calendar-view,1:#*]]\n\n## Working with Multiple Columns\n\nVSCode lets you create multiple columns of your editor and arrange them any way you want them.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/workbench.windows.gif)\n\n### Expanding the Current Editor\n\nYou can use the `toggleEditorWidth` command with a hotkey to quickly expand the current editor.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"command\": \"workbench.action.toggleEditorWidths\",\n    \"key\": \"ctrl+cmd+m\"\n}\n```\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/workbench.toggle-editor.gif)\n\n<!-- TODO\n\n### Zen Mode\n\n### Useful Shortcuts\n-->\n\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/f7ebd4aa-8ba7-4bc5-bd00-a1efc5315f07.html","relUrl":"notes/f7ebd4aa-8ba7-4bc5-bd00-a1efc5315f07.html"},{"doc":"Vaults","title":"Vaults","hpath":"dendron.topic.vaults","content":"\n## Summary\n\nYour workspace is made up of one or more **vaults**. A dendron vault stores a collection of related notes. If you're familiar with git, it's just like a code repo. By default, Dendron creates a _vaults_ folder when you first initialize a **workspace**. All your notes are stored on a per vault basis.\n\n```\n.\n└── workspace\n    ├── vault.main\n    │   ├── foo.md\n    │   ├── foo.one.md\n    │   └── foo.two.md\n    └── vault.secret (hypothetical)\n        ├── secret.one.md\n        └── secret.two.md\n```\n\nBy default, when you look for notes in Dendron, it will search over all vaults.\n\n## Commands\n\n### Vault Add\n- shortcuts: none\n\nAdd a new vault to your workspace.\n\nWhen you add a vault, you can choose between adding a local vault or a remote vault.\n\n#### Local Vault\n\nA local vault is a folder in your file system.\n\n#### Remote Vault\n\nA remote vault is a git repository. If you choose a remote vault, you can choose from a vault from the registry or enter a custom git url.\n\n##### Choosing from the registry\n\nCurrently, Dendron has four vaults in the registry:\n\n- [Dendron Vault](https://wiki.dendron.so/)\n- [AWS Vault](https://aws.dendron.so/)\n- [TLDR Vault](https://tldr.dendron.so/)\n- [XKCD Vault](https://xkcd.dendron.so/)\n\nThe first two correspond to the notes backing https://wiki.dendron.so/ and https://aws.dendron.so/ respectively.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/remote-vault.jpg)\n\nWhen you add a remote vault, the url can also point to a remote workspace. In that case, Dendron will inspect the `dendron.yml` to get a list of all vaults within the workspace and add all vaults from inside the workspace.\n\n<div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 62.5%; height: 0;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.loom.com/embed/b4171372f9794dd7be609c043f343fa3\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\"></iframe></div>\n\n### Vault Remove\n\n- shortcuts: none\n\nRemove a vault\n\nRemove a vault from your workspace.

Its a vault that is local to your file system.\n\n### Remote\n\nA remote vault is what you get when you run the [[Vault Add|dendron.topic.commands#vault-add]] command and select a remote vault. This is a vault that is cloned from a git repo. It should be a similar format as what you see below\n\n```yml \nvaults:\n    -\n        fsPath: dendron\n        remote:\n            type: git\n            url: 'git@github.com:dendronhq/dendron.git'\n```\n^NiCCqLjTG2nbM6Qi\n\nWhen someone pulls down a workspace with a `dendron.yml` that contains a remote vault, Dendron will automatically initialize the vault at the given `fsPath`. If the vault is a [[Workspace Vault|dendron.ref.vaults#workspace-vault]], Dendron will pull down the workspace to `{workspaceName}/fsPath`. \n\n## Vault Types\n\n### Regular Vault\n\nA regular vault is what you get by default when you first initialize your workspace. \n\n### Workspace Vault\nA workspace vault is a vault that belongs to another [[workspace|dendron.ref.workspace]]. It is automatically created when you run [[Vault Add|dendron.topic.vaults#vault-add]] on a [[workspace|dendron.ref.workspace]]. Upon adding a workspace, Dendron will add all the vaults of the given workspace inside your `dendron.yml` \n\nYou can see an example of the configuration [[here|dendron.topic.vaults#remote-workspace-vault]].\n\n## [[Configuration|dendron.topic.config.dendron]]\n\n### fsPath\n- file path to vault\n\n### name\n- default: last component of `fsPath`\n\nvault name\n\n### visibility\n- choices: \"private|public\"\n\nIf set to private, notes in this vault will not be published regardless of any other configuration. This takes precedences over everything. \n\n### workspace\n- required: false\n\nIf set, specifies the workspace that this vault belongs\n\n### remote\n- added property for [[remote vaults|dendron.ref.vaults#remote]]\n- properties\n    - type: currently only `git` is supported (in the future, we might add additional types)\n    - url: url to github repo\n\n\n### sync\n- default: `sync`\n\nSee [[workspace sync configuration options|dendron.ref.workspace#configuration-options]] for valid options.\n\nSets the [[synchronization strategy|dendron.ref.workspace#Workspace: Sync]] for this vault. This overrides the [[workspace vault sync option|dendron.topic.config.dendron#workspaceVaultSync]] if it is set.\n\n### Configuration Examples\n\n#### Local Vault\n\n```yml\nvaults:\n    - fsPath: vault\n```\n\nThis will have the following file layout\n\n```\n.\n└── workspace\n    └── vault\n\n```\n\n#### Remote Vault \n```yml\nvaults:\n    -\n        fsPath: dendron-vault\n        remote:\n            type: git\n            url: 'git@github.com:kevinslin/dendron-vault.git'\n        name: dendron\n        sync: sync\n    -\n        fsPath: yc-vault\n        remote:\n            type: git\n            url: 'git@github.com:kevinslin/yc-vault.git'\n        name: yc\n        sync: noPush\n```\n\nThis will have the following file layout\n```\n.\n└── workspace\n    |── dendron-vault\n    └── yc-vault\n\n```\n\n#### Remote Workspace Vault\n\n```yml\nvaults:\n    -\n        fsPath: handbook-vault\n        workspace: handbook-workspace\n        name: handbook\nworkspaces:\n    handbook:\n        remote:\n            type: git\n            url: 'git@github.com:dendronhq/handbook.git'\n\n```\n\nThis will have the following file layout\n```\n.\n└── workspace\n    └── handbook-workspace\n        └── handbook-vault\n\n```\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/6682fca0-65ed-402c-8634-94cd51463cc4.html","relUrl":"notes/6682fca0-65ed-402c-8634-94cd51463cc4.html"},{"doc":"Multi Vault","title":"Multi Vault","hpath":"dendron.topic.vaults.multi-vault","content":"\n## Summary\n\nMulti vault refers to managing multiple [[vaults|dendron.concepts#vaults]] within your workspace.\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- for **sensitive notes**, multi-vault enables local only vaults vs vaults that can be synced on file sharing services like Dropbox\n- for **modularizing knowledge**, multi-vault enables users to mix and match existing vaults depending on context\n- for **federating and curating knowledge**, multi-vault enables users to publish/subscribe to public vaults using protocols like `git`\n- for **access control**, multi-vault lets users configure specific vaults to be **private** which turns off publication and sharing of any notes inside said vault\n\n## Topics\n\n### Lookup\n\nLookup supports multiple vaults. When using lookup to find a note, each search result is labeled with which vault it belongs to.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/roots.jpg)\n\n#### Vault Location when Creating a Note\n\nWhen creating a note in lookup, Dendron will try to create your note in the correct vault. By default, it will place the note into the same vault as the currently opened note. But if it detects that the new note matches an existing hierarchy in a different vault, you will get prompted to pick the destination vault:\n\n![](https://org-dendron-public-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images/create-note-multi-vault-selection.png)\n\n#### Prompt for Vault Selection Each Time\n\n![[dendron.topic.config.dendron#lookupconfirmvaultoncreate:#*]]\n\nTo enable,  add `lookupConfirmVaultOnCreate: true` in the dendron configuration. Instructions to do so below.\n\n1. > Dendron: Configure (yaml)\n2. add `lookupConfirmVaultOnCreate: true` so your configuration looks like the following:\n\n```yml\nversion: 0\n...\nlookupConfirmVaultOnCreate: true\n```\n\n### Navigating Links\n\n- Sample workspace\n\n![[dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.multi-vault#file-layout-for-multi-vault-workspace,1:#*]]\n\n- navigating  to `[[foo]]` will result in a display prompting the user to select the vault to navigate to \n- navigating to `[[foo.two]]` will directly navigate to the note since it is unique across all vaults\n- navigating to `[[vault1/foo]]` will open `foo` in vault1 \n- navigating to `[[dendron://vault2/foo]]` will open `foo` in vault1\n\n### Note References\n\nWhen you make a reference, Dendron will include the note from the same note. You can create a reference to a note in a different vault by using [[cross vault links|dendron.topic.links#cross-vault-links]].\n\n### Publishing\n\nYou can publish from a multi-vault enabled workspace if you are using [[dendron-11ty|pkg.dendron-publishing]] to publish. \n\nWe have added a new configuration, `duplicateNoteBehavior`, which [[controls|dendron.topic.publishing.configuration#duplicatenotebehavior-optional]] how Dendron handles duplicate notes across multiple vaults.\n\n### Version Control\n\nFor multi-vault, there are several approaches to version control. If you are using Git, you can either commit everything as one repo or version control your workspace and each vault separately as distinct repos.\n\nIf you use `Vault: Add` with a remote vault, Dendron will automatically add the remote properties to your `dendron.yml` file. See example below.\n\n![[dendron.topic.vaults#remote-workspace-vault,1]]\n\nVersioned controlled vaults will be auto-initialized when someone pulls in the workspace. \n\nIf you want to convert a local vault to a remote vault, you can follow the instructions [[here|dendron.guides.cook#convert-local-vault-to-a-remote-vault]].\n\n#### File Layout for Multi-Vault Workspace\n\n```\n.\n└── Dendron\n    ├── .git\n    ├── dendron.code-workspace\n    ├── dendron.yml\n    ├── ...\n    ├── vault1\n    │   ├── .git\n    │   ├── root.md\n    │   └── ...\n    └── vault2\n        ├── .git\n        ├── root.md\n        └── ...\n```\n\n## Examples\n\n- Sample Multi-Vault workspace\n\n## Related\n\n- [[Cross Vault Links|dendron.topic.links#cross-vault-links]]\n- [[Using Dendron Across Machines|dendron.guides.best-practices#using-dendron-across-machines]]\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/24b176f1-685d-44e1-a1b0-1704b1a92ca0.html","relUrl":"notes/24b176f1-685d-44e1-a1b0-1704b1a92ca0.html"},{"doc":"Users","title":"Users","hpath":"dendron.topic.users","content":"\n## Summary\n\nDendron allows you to tag users in your notes. You can tag users inline like `@example`. They are similar to [[tags|dendron.topic.tags]], except that they are meant to reference users. In a vault shared with many people, where each person can have their own user note. Or you can also use it yourself to keep track of information about people you know.\n\n## User tags\n\nA user tag is anything following `@` without spaces or other punctuation.\n\n```md\n@example.username\n```\n\nThe user tag will look like @example.username. Try clicking on this link!\n\nIn Dendron, user tags are just a shorthand for writing `[[@my-example|user.example.my-example]]`. You can format your tags as wikilinks if you run into any limitations with tags.\n\n\n### Navigation\n\nTo look at the user note, you can click on the user tag while holding down `Ctrl`, press `Ctrl+Enter` on your keyboard, or use the \"Dendron: Goto Note\" command.\n\n### Punctuation\n\nOne thing to remember: You can't include things like spaces, quotation marks,\nquestion marks in user tags. For #example, see how \"these #tags\" don't include\nthe punctuation marks around them. This makes it natural to use tags within\nsentences.\n\n### Multi-vault\n\nUser tags can't specify which vault they are in. This is not a problem most of the\ntime, Dendron will find the user note wherever it is. But if you have the\nsame user note in multiple vaults and you want to clarify which one, you can use a\n[[Cross Vault Link|dendron.topic.links#cross-vault-links]] instead since user tags\nare just wikilinks.\n\n\n### Details\nYou might have already noticed this when you opened the user tag, but user notes are\njust notes under the `user.` hierarchy.

There are two supported ways of using templates:\n\n1. The easiest way is to have a templates.\\* hierarchy in your vault and store commonly used note templates there. You can then re-use these templates in other notes by using the `Dendron: Insert Note` command in vscode. By default, this hasn't been assigned a keybinding, but you can always map this to something easy to remember if you find yourself using a lot of templates.\n\n<div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 59.900166389351085%; height: 0;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.loom.com/embed/7de6f7aa9f474a0c8555e7d66928c3ac\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\"></iframe></div>\n\n2. A more automatic way is by referencing templates in your schema and then having the template automatically applied when a new note of a particular type is created. This is described in more detail in the [[note on schemas|dendron.topic.schema#template]].\n\n### Built-In Templates 🚧\n\nYou can also pick from a set of built-in templates that contain a set of commonly used note styles to help you get started. These templates can be pulled down with the seeds mechanism. The seed containing templates is called `dendron.templates`, substitute `dendron.dendron-site` for `dendron.templates` in the example below\n\n![[dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.topic.seed-bank.quickstart#adding-a-seed-to-an-existing-workspace]]\n\nWe are continually working to expand the types of templates available in the `dendron.template` seed.\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/861cbdf8-102e-4633-9933-1f3d74df53d2.html","relUrl":"notes/861cbdf8-102e-4633-9933-1f3d74df53d2.html"},{"doc":"Teams","title":"Teams","hpath":"dendron.topic.teams","content":"\n## Summary\n\nThis goes over some best practices when using Dendron for teams. \n\n<!-- To get started, you can use this [[quickstart|dendron.topic.teams.quickstart]]. -->\n\n## Workspace\n\nWe recommend getting started by using the example in our [github template](https://github.com/dendronhq/org-workspace-template). \n\nThis will create a workspace with the following structure\n\n```\n.\n└── workspace\n    ├── org-private\n    └── org-dev\n```\n\nFollow the instructions of [[converting a local vault to a remote vault|dendron.guides.cook#converting-a-local-vault-to-a-remote-vault]] if you wish to make each individual vault a github repository\n\n## Vaults\n\n### main\n- org-private: \n  - for company private notes\n- org-dev: \n  - for developer related notes\n\n### optional\n- org-admin: \n  - for sensitive data that you don't want to share with everyone in the company \n- org-public\n  - for company material that you plan on publishing publically\n\n## Schemas\n- NOTE: you can get a copy of these schemas by adding this [vault](https://github.com/kevinslin/schemas)\n<!-- -->\n- company.yml\n  - this reflects your company hierarchy\n- team.yml\n  - this is used for your team\n- user.yml\n  - this is used for users\n\n## Hiearchies\n- user.{username}.journal.{date}: use for daily updates from individual people\n- org.standup.{date}: use for standups\n  - when the company grows, you can divide org into team specific standups (s/org/team.{teamName}/g)\n- meet.journal.{date}: use for notes on meetings\n\n## Example Workspace\n\n```\n.\n├── .\n├── dendron.code-workspace\n├── dendron.yml\n├── org-private/\n│   ├── root.md\n│   ├── acme.onboarding\n│   ├── team.backend.onboarding\n│   ├── team.backend.standup.2020.03.29\n│   ├── ...\n│   ├── user.alice.journal.2020.03.29\n    └── user.bob.journal.2020.03.29\n```\n\n## Helpful Commands\n\nWhen you're working with multiple repositories, here are a few useful commands to use:\n\n### Vault Add ([[docs|dendron.topic.commands#vault-add]])\n\nAdding vaults to your team's workspace is as easy as running this command and pointing to either a local or remote vault.\n\n### Move note ([[docs|dendron.topic.commands#move-note]])\n\nMove note will allow you to move notes quickly from one vault to another (potentially to make it public or provide more strict access control).\n\n### Refactor Hierarchy ([[dendron.topic.commands#refactor-hierarchy]])\n\nUse the refactor hierarchy command to bulk-move notes from one hierarchy/structure to another.\n\n### Workspace Sync\n\n![[dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.topic.commands#workspace-sync,1:#*]]\n\n### User Private Vaults\n\nIf you want to set it up so that each of your team members have private vaults in addition to the team vaults, have each of your team mebmers initialize a Dendron workspace locally. They can then add the team workspace as a remote [[workspace vault|dendron.topic.vaults#workspace-vault]] by entering the git endpoint where the workspace is located.\n\n## Related\n- See the [Dendron handbook](https://handbook.dendron.so/notes/fc057be8-80e7-4a08-bca6-5bd6bc398eea.html) to see how we organize our own teams workspace ","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/98f6d928-3f61-49fb-9c9e-70c27d25f838.html","relUrl":"notes/98f6d928-3f61-49fb-9c9e-70c27d25f838.html"},{"doc":"Quickstart","title":"Quickstart","hpath":"dendron.topic.teams.quickstart","content":"\n\nThis guide will cover setting up the layout describe above. \n\n1.

Run [[Vault Remove|dendron.topic.commands#vault-remove]] to remove the default `vault` that got created when you created the workspace\n1. For every vault you created, create a git repository and convert it to a remote vault by following the instructions [[here|dendron.guides.cook#converting-a-local-vault-to-a-remote-vault]]. When your done, the vaults section of your `dendron.yml` should look something like the below.\n  ```yml\n  vaults:\n      -\n          fsPath: dendron\n          remote:\n              type: git\n              url: 'git@github.com:dendronhq/dendron.git'\n  ```\n1.

They can run [[Change Workspace|dendron.topic.commands#change-workspace]] with the path to the workspace to initialize it. Dendron will initiate all remote vaults during the process.\n1. (Optional): Add the [schema vault](https://github.com/kevinslin/schemas) as a [[remote vault|dendron.topic.vaults#remote]] to get access to some useful schemas\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/31cb97b5-4ac7-48dd-abcf-107ce78ea8ae.html","relUrl":"notes/31cb97b5-4ac7-48dd-abcf-107ce78ea8ae.html"},{"doc":"Tags","title":"Tags","hpath":"dendron.topic.tags","content":"\n## Summary\n\nDendron supports adding tags to your notes. Tags can be added either inline as a hashtag (eg. `#foo`) or in the [[dendron.topic.frontmatter]].\n\n## Hashtags\n\nA hashtag is anything following `#` without any spaces. \n\n```md\n#example.my-example\n```\n\nThe tag will look like #example.my-example.\n\nIn Dendron, tags are just a shorthand for writing `[[#example.my-example|tags.example.my-example]]`. You can format your tags as wikilinks if you run into any limitations with tags.\n\n\n### Navigation\n\nTo find all notes that were tagged with this tag, you can click on it while holding down `Ctrl`, press `Ctrl+Enter` on your keyboard, or use the \"Dendron: Goto Note\" command.  Once you open the tag, expand the Backlinks section on your editor to see everywhere this tag was used.\n\n### Punctuation\n\nOne thing to remember: You can't include things like spaces, quotation marks,\nquestion marks in hashtags. For #example, see how \"these #tags\" don't include\nthe punctuation marks around them. This makes it natural to use tags within\nsentences.\n\n\n### Autocomplete (intellisense)\n\nTags support autocomplete (intellisense), but tag notes must be created for\nautocomplete to work. To create a tag note, select the\ntag and use \"Dendron: Goto Note\" command or hit \"Ctrl+enter\".\n\n### Custom colors\n\nTags are automatically assigned colors to help you identify them easily. If you\ndon't like the automatic colors, you can always override what color the tags\nshould be by setting the `color` in the frontmatter of the tag note. For\nexample, the following tag is #blue, and you can click on it to see how to customize the color.\n\nSetting a tag color affects the colors of all tags within the hierarchy. For\nexample, the tag #example is set to color red, so #example.my-example is also\nred. This allows you to organize your tags with color codes. You can always\noverride the color deeper within the hierarchy, we could set\n`#example.my-example` to green while keeping `#example` red.\n\nNote that the color you assign your tag will aslo be displayed in the [[Dendron Tree View|dendron.topic.workbench#dendron-tree-view]].\n\n### Publishing\n\nTags work in publishing like regular links. The only caveat is that if you want\nyour viewers to see all notes that use a tag, you must create that tag note.\nOtherwise, Dendron will just tell them that this note did not sprout yet. We're\nworking on an improvement to this, so keep an eye out for updates!\n\nSomething else worth mentioning is that the automatic tag colors can be disabled\nin publishing. See the [[noRandomlyColoredTags|dendron.topic.publishing.configuration#norandomlycoloredtags]] configuration.\n\n### Multi-vault\n\nTags can't specify which vault they are in. This is not a problem most of the\ntime, Dendron will find your tag wherever it is. But if you have the\nsame tag in multiple vaults and you want to clarify which one, you can use a\n[[Cross Vault Link|dendron.topic.links#cross-vault-links]] instead since tags\nare just wikilinks.\n\n\n### Details\nYou might have already noticed this when you opened the tag, but tags are just notes under the `tags.` hierarchy. This has a lot of benefits:\n\n-   You can use commands like [[Rename Note|dendron.topic.commands#rename-note]] or [[Refactor Hierarchy|dendron.topic.commands#refactor-hierarchy]] to rename or reorganize your tags, and it will update all notes where these tags were used.\n-   You can add content to your tag and it will show up when you hover over the tag in the editor, or when you publish it. Try clicking on the example tag above!\n-   You can organize your tags into hierarchies (like `#cuisine.ethiopian` and `#cuisine.swedish`).\n-   You can link tags together by adding links in their content.\n\n## Frontmatter tags\n\nYou can also put tags in the [[frontmatter|dendron.topic.frontmatter]] of your note. For example, the frontmatter of your note with a tag may look like this:\n\n```\n---\nid: QXPVbTIZTch9hUOVtScsu\ntitle: My Note\ndesc: \"\"\nupdated: 1628065917670\ncreated: 1628065917670\ntags: my.example\n---\n```\n\nThis will link the note to the tag `tags.my.example`. To add multiple tags, you can write them in multiple lines:\n\n```\ntags:\n    - my.example\n    - other.one\n```\n\nOr, within a single line:\n\n```\ntags: [my.example, other.one]\n```\n\nThis note actually has a frontmatter tag set. You can see what it looks like published at the bottom of the page.\n\n## Additional Customizations\n\nYou can further customize the look of tags in the preview by using the following CSS modification.\n\n![[dendron.guides.tips#stylized-tags-using-custom-css:#*]]\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/8bc9b3f1-8508-4d3a-a2de-be9f12ef1821.html","relUrl":"notes/8bc9b3f1-8508-4d3a-a2de-be9f12ef1821.html"},{"doc":"Style","title":"Style","hpath":"dendron.topic.style","content":"## Colors\n\n|Color   | Pantone   | Hex    |\n|---|---| ---|\n|![](/assets/images/2021-03-16-10-28-40.png)| 361 C   | #43B02A    |\n| ![](/assets/images/2021-03-16-10-29-08.png)  | 3435 C   | #154734    |\n| ![](/assets/images/2021-03-16-10-29-28.png)  | Neutral Black C   | #232222    |\n\n## Logo\n\n![logo](/assets/images/logo.png)\n\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/734a8c36-baff-43d1-8b12-99bb16837049.html","relUrl":"notes/734a8c36-baff-43d1-8b12-99bb16837049.html"},{"doc":"Special Notes","title":"Special Notes","hpath":"dendron.topic.special-notes","content":"\nDendron has built-in support for a variety of special note formats.

This is why Dendron has **schemas** to help you manage your notes at scale. Think of schemas as an **optional type system** for your notes. They describe the hierarchy of your data and are themselves, represented as a hierarchy.\n\nSchemas show up as icons next to lookup results.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/schema.intro.gif)\n\n<!-- ## Why Use Schemas\n\nSchemas help you categorize your notes by making sure your hierarchies are consistent with one another.  -->\n\n## Features\n\n### Schema Completions\n\nSchemas will autosuggest valid children when you create a new project.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/schema.suggest.gif)\n\n### Find Non-Compliant Hierarchies\n\nIf you accidentally do a typo, your schema will let you know that you have an inconsistency. \n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/schema.unknown.gif)\n\n## Schema Anatomy\n\nA schema is a YAML file with the following naming scheme `{name}.schema.yml`\n\nBelow is an example of a four-level hierarchy describing cli commands. The `id` field of the schema is used to build a [glob pattern](https://facelessuser.github.io/wcmatch/glob/) which will be used to match notes matching the schema.\n\n```yml\nversion: 1\nschemas:\n# this will match \"cli.*\" notes\n- id: cli \n  # human readable description of hierarchy\n  desc: command line interface reference\n  # add this to the domain of your schema hierarchy\n  parent: root\n  # when a schema is a namespace, it can have arbitrary children. equivalent to cli.* glob pattern\n  namespace: true \n  children:\n    - cmd\n    - env\n# will match cli.*.env\n- id: env\n  desc: cli specific env variables\n# will match cli.*.cmd.*\n- id: cmd\n  desc: subcommands \n  namespace: true\n```\n\nBelow is another way of representing the above schema\n\n```\n.\n└── cli # matches cli\n    └── {cli child} # matches cli.*\n        ├── env # matches cli.*.env\n        └── cmd # matches cli.*.cmd\n            └── {cmd child} # matches cli.*.cmd.*\n```\n\n\n\n## Properties\n\n### version (optional): number\n\n- values: `0|1`\n- default: 0\n- description: schema version number\n\n### imports (optional): str\\[]\n\n- values: list of schemas to import\n- default: \\[]\n- description: import schemas from another schema into the current schema\n  - when using schemas from an external schema file, you will need to prefix the schema with the file name without the `schema.yml` suffix\n- NOTE: `import` is only available in schema version `1`\n\nExample:\n\n- foo.schema. yml\n\n```yml\nversion: 1\nimports:\n- bar\nschemas:\n- id: foo\n  parent: root\n  children:\n    - bar.bar # notice that we prefix the id bar with the filename\n```\n\n- bar.schema.yml\n\n```yml\nversion: 1\nschemas:\n- id: bar\n  parent: root\n  children: \n    - one\n- id: one\n```\n\nThe above would match the following files\n\n```\nfoo.bar # match\nfoo.bar.one #match\n```\n\n### schemas\n\n- list of schema definitions\n\n#### id\n\nthe identifier of the schema. also designates the glob pattern match. this is the **only** required part of a schema. all other fields are optional\n\n#### desc\n\nhuman readable description of the schema node. these will automatically when creating notes that match the schema.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/schema-desc.gif)\n\n#### parent\n\n- only required for schema [domain](https://www.dendron.so/notes/c6fd6bc4-7f75-4cbb-8f34-f7b99bfe2d50.html#domain)\n- NOTE: at least one schema MUST have `parent: root` set \n\n#### namespace\n\nmaking a schema node a namespace automatically brings its immediate children as part of the schema, even if they are not explicitly defined in the schema definition. it will also automatically set the pattern to `{namespace}.*`\n\n- example:\n\n```yml\nschemas:\n- id: project\n  parent: root\n  namespace: true\n```\n\n- this will match: \n  - `project`\n  - `project.foo`\n  - `project.bar`\n- it will not match\n  - `project.foo.bar`\n\n#### pattern\n\nglob pattern that schema matches. by default, this is the `id` of the schema. you can override this. \n\nFor example, take a look at the journal schema below\n\n```yml\nschemas:\n- id: journal\n  title: journal\n  desc: \"\"\n  parent: root\n  children:\n    - year\n- id: year\n  title: year\n  pattern: \"[0-2][0-9][0-9][0-9]\"\n  children: \n    - month\n- id: month\n  title: month\n  pattern: \"[0-9][0-9]\"\n  children: \n    - day\n- id: day\n  title: day\n  pattern: \"[0-9][0-9]\"\n  namespace: true\n```\n\nThis will match the following queries\n\n```\n# journal\n# journal.2020\n# journal.2020.09\n# journal.2020.09.12\n# journal.2020.09.12.foo.md\n```\n\n#### children\n\nlist of ids of schemas that are the child of the current schema\n\n#### template\n\na template you can apply to all notes that match this schema. See **Schema Templates** for more details.\n\n```yml\ntemplate:\n  # identifier for the template (for a note based template, it would be the name of the note)\n  id: journal.template.daily\n  # what sort of template we are creating. currently, only 'note' is supported\n  type: note\n\n```\n\n## Schema Templates\n\nSchema templates let you designate a note as a **template**. Newly created notes that match a schema with a template will have both the contents and custom frontmatter of the template note applied at creation.\n\nThis is extremely useful whenever you want to re-use the outline of a note. Examples include daily journals, weekly shopping lists, and weekly reviews.  \n\n- NOTE: you'll need to run `Reload Workspace` for any new templates to take effect\n\n<a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/481b7ab051394c1caa383383bd265755\"> \n<img style=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/481b7ab051394c1caa383383bd265755-with-play.gif\"> \n</a>\n\n## Unknown Schema\n\nDendron doesn't force you to use schemas if you don't want to. This is why you can create notes that don't match any schema. Dendron will show you a `?` next to these results.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/schema-question.jpg)\n\n> Sometimes ~~rules~~ schemas are meant to be broken\n\n## Working with Schemas\n\nSchemas can be modified, created and deleted using the same lookup interface that you use for regular notes. See [[lookup|dendron.topic.lookup]] for further details about working with schemas.\n\n## Example Schemas\n<!-- - [Project and Journal](https://gist.github.com/kevinslin/5ca7a6f25a239add5ea374f329e6a19e) -->\n- Example schemas can be found [here](https://github.com/kevinslin/schemas.git)\n- You can copy and paste the individual schema files or add it as a [[remote Vault|dendron.topic.vaults#remote]] and keep up to date on changes\n- Its pretty bare right now but plan on adding a lot more here over time. contributions most welcome :)\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Error with parsing some schemas during initialization\n\nIf you get this error, it means that Dendron encountered some malformed schemas during initialization. You can open the error message to see what schemas are affected.\n\nCommon errors:\n\n- the YAML isn't valid (use <http://www.yamllint.com/> to validate)\n- there is no schema with `parent: root` property \n\n![[dendron.topic.schema#parent:#*]]\n\n## Cookbook\n\n### Testing schemas\n\nIf you want to test what your schemas will match, you can use a glob tester like [Glob tester](https://globster.xyz/) to do so\n\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/c5e5adde-5459-409b-b34d-a0d75cbb1052.html","relUrl":"notes/c5e5adde-5459-409b-b34d-a0d75cbb1052.html"},{"doc":"Schema Library","title":"Schema Library","hpath":"dendron.topic.schema.lib","content":"\n## Summary\n- [[Experimental 🧪|dendron.ref.status#experimental-🧪]]\n\nThe schema library is a collection of existing schemas contributed by the community.

This differs from [links]([[Links|dendron.topic.links]]), which do not embed content and just provide navigational context.\n\nNote references are extremely powerful and help you re-use your notes in a variety of places.\n\nCurrently, Dendron supports 4 types of references to help you control the amount of content that gets embedded:\n\n- full note references\n- header references\n- block references\n- range references\n\nReferences have the following syntax:\n\n```\n![[name.of.note]]\n```\n\nHere's an example with a block anchor:\n\n```\n![[name.of.note#^important-paragraph]]\n```\n\nAnother example with a header range:\n\n```\n![[name.of.note#starting-header:#ending-header]]\n```\n\n> NOTE: When referencing headers with spaces in them, the note ref needs to use `-` instead of spaces within the name. This is a limitation of adopting GitHub-style slugger references. This is also useful for when multiple subheaders on a page may have the same name, which would expect something else `#foo` vs. `#foo-1` vs. `#foo-2`. This can be automatically taken care of by highlighting a header, and using `cmd+shift+r` / `ctrl+shift+r` to add a properly-formatted note ref to the clipboard.\n>\n> For more information:\n> - [StackOverflow: How to escape symbols in GitHub-flavored markdown internal links / heading anchors?](https://stackoverflow.com/a/48760076/5340149)\n> - [Anchors in Markdown gist](https://gist.github.com/asabaylus/3071099)\n\n\n## Reference Types\n\n### Full Note References\n\nThe simplest type is a full note reference, which will include the entire contents of a note within another note. Below is an example of a note reference.\n\n```\n![[dendron.demo.refs.sample]]\n```\n\n### Header References\n\nA block reference will include the entire contents of a note starting from a specified heading.\n\n```\n![[demo.embed.block#head1]]\n```\n\n### Block References\n\nBlock references let you link or embed blocks of text into different parts of your notes. This allows you to link and refer to any part of a note, including paragraphs, lists, and tables. Block references use the `^` caret as the anchor.\n\n^block-ref-example\n\n```\n![[example.my-note#^my-list]]\n```\n\nBlock References allow you to embed a block marked by an anchor in another note. \n\nHere are a few examples:\n\n```\nAb voluptatem commodi maiores.\nNemo qui voluptatem dolores. ^my-paragraph\n\n* Culpa autem et voluptatem reiciendis id sint.\n* Qui quos ut a deserunt. ^second-item\n    * Sub-item\n* Minima quos consequatur quo eum quas aut.\n\n^all-items\n\nI want to refer to that paragraph again:\n\n![[#^my-paragraph]]\n\nAnd let's look at that list again:\n\n![[#^all-items]]\n\nI want to re-emphasize that second item:\n\n![[#^second-item]]\n\nThe second item, without the sub-item under it:\n\n![[#^second-item:#^second-item]]\n\nYou can reference across notes as well. Say you had a note named \"other-note\" which had an anchor \"some-anchor\" in it:\n\n![[other-note#^some-anchor]]\n```\n\nWhen you refer to a block anchor, it will display the block that the block anchor is attached to. This means you can refer to an entire paragraph, table, list, or even a list item.\n\nBelow is an example to a block reference to an earlier part of this page.\n\n![[#^block-ref-example]]\n\n#### Block Anchor\n\nA block anchor is a `^` character, followed by one or more digits, letters, dashes, and underscores. In the future Dendron will automatically generate these, but for now you can add in custom anchors. The following are a few examples of anchors:\n\n```\nLorem ipsum dolor amet ^1234\n\n* Item 1\n* Item 2 ^second-item\n* Item 3\n\n^whole-list\n\n| Sapiente | accusamus |\n|----------|-----------|\n| Laborum  | libero    |\n| Ullam    | optio     | ^whole-table\n```\n\n`^whole-list`, `^whole-table`, and `^1234` reference the blocks they are attached to. Lists are special though, `^second-item` only references the list item it is next to.\n\n#### Block Links\n\nBlock Anchors can also be used as links. A block link has the following format. It is created in a note that is referencing a piece of text. When navigating the link, users should be taken to the block anchor. \n\n```\n[[somelink#^1234]]\n```\n\nBlock links can link to anchors within the same note without writing the name of the note. For example:\n\n```\nAb voluptatem commodi maiores.\nNemo qui voluptatem dolores. ^my-paragraph\n\nLet's look back at that paragraph: [[#^my-paragraph]]\n```\n\n### Range Reference\n\nA range reference will include the contents of a note starting from a starting header or block anchor, and ending at an ending header or block anchor. The syntax is `![[note#start:#end]]`.\n\n#### Example With Headers as Range Boundary\n\n```\n![[demo.embed.block#head1:#head3]]\n```\n\n#### Example With Blocks as Range Boundary\n\n```\n# Section\n\nSunt animi inventore atque quia ex aut minus.\nVoluptate ipsa et esse. ^paragraph-1\n\nPorro ad nesciunt sed eius ut enim est eveniet.\nOmnis sint necessitatibus aut. ^paragraph-2\n\n* Aliquam et sit autem. ^first\n* Est sapiente quis ut est.\n* Est incidunt et debitis vel ab. ^third\n* Maxime harum aut mollitia debitis ipsa.\n\nBoth paragraphs:\n\n![[#^paragraph-1:#^paragraph-2]]\n\nFirst 3 items in my list:\n\n![[#^first:#^third]]\n\nFrom the header, to the second paragraph:\n\n![[#section:#^paragraph-2]]\n```\n\n## Commands\n\nYou can create a reference either by hand or using the `Copy Note Ref` command.\n\n![[dendron.topic.commands#copy-note-ref:#*]]\n\n## Additional Options\n\n### Line Offset\n\nYou can use line offsets to skip a number of lines when using a header reference. The syntax is `,{number}`. Below is an example of using a note reference offset to offset an initial heading, skipping the actual header when doing the embedding.\n\n- NOTE: currently, note reference offsets are limited to the first anchor inside a block reference. They must also be a positive value\n\n```\n![[demo.embed.block#head1,1]]\n```\n\n### Wildcard Headers as a Range Boundary\n\nWhen you're referencing a header by reference, sometimes you don't care what the next header is, just that the reference covers all text up to the next header. You can specify this using the `*` symbol in a header reference.\n\nFor example, the following would reference the content from header1 to the next header.\n\n```\n![[demo.embed.block#head1:#*]]\n```\n\n### Recursive References\n\nReferences can refer to notes with references inside. Dendron current supports references two levels deep. This applies to both the **local preview** as well as **publishing**.\n\n### Wildcard Link Reference\n\nReferences accept the `*` operator at the end which lets you grab all notes of a given level of hierarchy. This also works with typical note reference operation like block selection which means you can use it to grab specific blocks from every note in a level.\n\n```\n![[demo.journal.2021.*]]\n```\n\n## Publishing\n\nWhen you [[publish|dendron.topic.publishing]] a note with a note reference, Dendron will embed the content of the reference in the page. If the content is part of a published page as specified by the publishing [[configuration|dendron.topic.publishing.configuration]], dendron will include a link to the page. If not, Dendron will embed the content without a link. If the referenced content is not publishable (eg. `published: false` set on frontmatter), dendron will generate a custom [[404 link|dendron.topic.publishing.features#selective-publication]].\n\n## Configuration\n\n- note references by default come with an outline. They are called [[pretty refs|dendron.ref.terms#pretty-ref]].\n\nToggle the following configuration to turn off this setting.\n\n![[dendron.topic.config.dendron#useprettyrefs:#*]]\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/f1af56bb-db27-47ae-8406-61a98de6c78c.html","relUrl":"notes/f1af56bb-db27-47ae-8406-61a98de6c78c.html"},{"doc":"Publishing","title":"Publishing","hpath":"dendron.topic.publishing","content":"\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/579e379b-3eca-4676-b51c-c66eb26a11b8.html","relUrl":"notes/579e379b-3eca-4676-b51c-c66eb26a11b8.html"},{"doc":"Troubleshooting","title":"Troubleshooting","hpath":"dendron.topic.publishing.troubleshooting","content":"\n## Diagnostics\n\n## Issues\n\n### Site Preview shows \"Cannot Get/\"\n\nCauses:\n\n1.

(As in the example screen cap below, the url shown is `https://kevinslin.github.io/dendron-publish-sample/`, then the SITE_URL would be ` https://kevinslin.github.io`)\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/publishv2.github-url.jpg)\n- NOTE: \n    - if you setup your github repository name as `{username}.github.io`, your SITE_URL will be `{username}.github.io`\n    - if you use an arbitrary name for your github repository (as in the example above, the repo name is `dendron-publish-sample`)\n      - your SITE_URL will be `{username}.github.io`\n      - And you will need to add the suffix using the `assetsPrefix` property (eg. `assetsPrefix: dendron-publish-sample`)\n\n#### Examples\n- publishing the repo named `kevinslin.github.io`\n\n```yml\nsite:\n    siteUrl: https://kevinslin.github.io\n```\n\n- publishing the repo named `dendron-publish-sample`\n\n```yml\nsite:\n    assetsPrefix: dendron-publish-sample\n    siteUrl: https://kevinslin.github.io\n```\n\n### Build your notes for publication\n\nIn order to have Dendron generate your website, you open the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P`) and use the `Dendron: Site Build` command.\n\n### Publish your notes\n\nYou open the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P`) and use the [[Workspace: Sync|dendron.topic.commands#workspace-sync]] command.\n\nOr you can calmly type in your terminal to commit all your changes (`git add .` then `git commit`) and perform a `git push`.\n\nGitHub will synchronize all changes and publish your notes everytime you push.\n\n```bash\nopit add .\ngit commit -m \"first dendron page\"\ngit push\n```\n\nWhen you are done, you should see a page like the one [here](https://kevinslin.github.io/dendron-publish-sample/)\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/publishv2.den-wel.jpg)\n\n\n### Congratulations, you just published your first note 🌱\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/230d0ccf-5758-4a8f-b39b-3b68e1482e2b.html","relUrl":"notes/230d0ccf-5758-4a8f-b39b-3b68e1482e2b.html"},{"doc":"Preview Your Site","title":"Preview Your Site","hpath":"dendron.topic.publishing.quickstart.preview-your-site","content":"\n\n## CLI\n\nThe following describes how to prepare your notes for publication using [[Dendron CLI|dendron.topic.cli]].\n\n### Pre-requisites\n\n- node version 12 or higher, see installation guide [[here|dendron.guides.install-node]]\n\n### Requirements\n\n- pre-requisitie: \n  - node version 12 or higher, see installation guide [[here Node|dendron.guides.install-node]]\n\n### Setup\n\nIn order to to publish, run the following commands inside your workspace.\n\n```bash\nnpm init -y\nnpm install @dendronhq/dendron-cli@latest\nnpm install @dendronhq/dendron-11ty-legacy@latest\n```\n\n### Local Preview\n\nAfter you have your dependencies installed, build your site using the following command inside your workspace root.\n\n```bash\nnpx dendron buildSite  --stage dev --serve\n```\n\nThis will both compile your site locally and make it available at `localhost:8080` for instant preview.

When a duplicate is found, Dendron will go through the vaults in your list from left to right and resolve to the first one that matches.\n\n- NOTE: this is done automatically when you run the [[Vault Add|dendron.topic.commands#vault-add]] command \n\n```yml\nduplicateNoteBehavior: \n  action: \"useVault\"\n  payload: [{vault1}, {vault2}, {vault3}]\n```\n\n### ga_tracking \nYour ga tracking number if you want to add google analytics. \n\n- NOTE: \n  - won't be included in `dev` preview.\n  - we (as Dendron organization) are not using this to track analytics on individual user's personal sites.\n\n### githubCname\n- default: none\n\nCname used for github pages\n\n### logo \n\n- default: none\n- eg: `vault/assets/images/logo.png`\n\nUsed to add a logo image to site. Logo will appear in:\n- site header\n- as the default image if no `image` property is set for a note\n\n### previewPort\n\n- default: 8080\n\nSet a different port when using the [[buildSite|dendron.topic.cli#buildsite]] command.\n\n### siteFaviconPath \n\n- default: \"favicon.ico\"\n\nPath to favicon. Relative to workspace.\n\n- NOTE: this is deprecated in nextjs publishing (favicon can be placed directly in the `/public` dir)\n\n### siteHierarchies \n\n- default: [root]\n\nList of hierarchies to publish. `root` is a special value that means `publish all`.\n\n### siteLastModified \n\n- default: false\n\nIf set to true, show a last modified at the bottom of your site. This value is set form the `updated` timestamp in your note frontmatter.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/publishv2.last-modified.jpg)\n\n### siteIndex \n\n- default: first element of `siteHiearchies`\n\nPath of your index (home page)\n\n### siteRootDir \n\n- default: \"docs\"\n\nLocation of the directory where site will be build. Relative to your workspace\n\n<!-- ### siteRepoDir \n\n- default: none\n- status: NOT currently supported \n\nLocation of the github repo where your site notes are located. By default, this is assumed to be your `workspaceRoot` if not set. This is used with the `Publish Notes` command -->\n\n### siteUrl \n- required\n\nSet to the URL that you plan on publishing to. All links will be prefixed with this. \nIf you are publishing with github pages, the format is `https://{username}.github.io/{repo}/`\n\n### usePrettyRefs \n- status: optional\n- default: True\n\nWhether to use pretty note refs or plain refs. \n\n### noRandomlyColoredTags\n- status: optional\n- default: false\n\nDo not display the automatically generated colors for tags. Only tag colors set\nby the user are used, other tags won't have colors and will look like regular\nlinks.\n\n### showFrontMatterTags\n- status: optional\n- default: true\n\nWhether [[frontmatter tags|dendron.topic.tags#frontmatter-tags]] should be rendered in published websites.\n\n### writeStubs \n- status: optional\n- default: true\n\nWhether to write [[stubs|dendron.concepts#stubs]] when publishing. \n\nWriting a stub will create an empty note in your vault with the name of the stub. \n\nWriting stubs is important to guarantee permanent urls as Dendron will randomize stub ids whenever Dendron restarts. \n\n### Github Options\n\n#### gh_edit_link\n\n- default: true\n  Show a edit on github link at the bottom of the page\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/publish.edit-on-github.jpg)\n\n#### gh_edit_repository\n\nthe URL of the project's GitHub repository\n\n- NOTE: if you are using [[remote vaults|dendron.topic.vaults#remote]], this value will be ignored and the [[remote url|dendron.topic.config.dendron#remote]] will be used instead\n\n#### gh_edit_branch\n\n- default: main\n\nthe branch that the docs site is served from\n\n#### gh_edit_view_mode\n\n- default: tree (brings user to github page)\n\nswitch to \"edit\" to bring the user directly into editing mode\n\n### SEO Options\n\n#### title\n\n- title of page\n- eg: `Dendron`\n\n#### description\n\n- eg: `Dendron is a local-first, markdown based, hierarchical note taking tool. It is meant to help you create, organize, and collaborate on knowledge bases of any size.`\n\n#### author\n\nName of person or organization doing the publishing\n\n- eg: `Kevin`\n\n#### twitter\n\nTwitter Handle\n\n- eg: `dendronhq`\n\n## Hierarchy Configuration\n\nYou can update configuration on a per hierarchy level by modifying `site.config` like in the example below\n\n```yml\nsite:\n  config: \n    dendron:\n      publishByDefault: true\n      ...\n```\n\nTo set options for **all** hierarchies, set `{hiearchy name}` to **root**.\n\n### publishByDefault\n\n- default: true \n- values: true|false|hashByVault\n\nIf set to false, dendron will only publish notes within the hierarchy that have `published: true` set in the frontmatter\n\nIf set as a hash, you can further specify `publishByDefault` settings on a per vault basis. The key is the name of the vault and the value is a boolean. \n\nFor example, the following config says that the `finance` hierarchy in the `public` vault should all be published but that the `finance` hierarchy in the `private` vault should not\n\n```yml\nsite: \n  config:\n    finance:\n      publishByDefault:\n        public: true\n        private: false\n```\n\n### noindexByDefault\n\n- default: false\n- status: NOT currently supported\n\nIf set to true, dendron will add the following meta tag `<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"noindex, nofollow”>` which will tell google to not index your page\n\nWhen google indexes a page, it will penalize sites that have duplicate content from other sites. this is useful if you are using your hiearchy as a [[cache|dendron.workflows.cache]]\n\n### customFrontmatter\n\n- default: \\[]\n\nIf set, dendron will add the specified frontmatter to each published note in the hierarchy. note that this will override existing keys with the same name when publishing\n\n- eg. add `toc: true` to all notes published under the `iam.*` hierarchy\n\n```yml\n  config:\n    iam: \n        customFrontmatter: [\n          {\n            key: \"toc\",\n            value: true,\n          }\n        ]\n```\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example publishing entire vault\n\n- vault\n\n```\n.\n├── root.md\n├── dendron.md\n├── dendron.quickstart.md\n├── dendron.zen.md\n├── flowers.md\n└── flowers.bud.md\n```\n\n- dendron.yml\n\n```yml\npublish:\n  siteHierarchies: [root]\n```\n\n- what gets published\n\n```\n.\n└── root.md\n    ├── dendron\n    │   ├── dendron.quickstart\n    │   └── dendron.zen\n    └── flowers\n        └── flowers.bud\n```\n\n### Example publishing just one domain\n\n- vault\n\n```\n.\n├── root.md\n├── dendron.md\n├── dendron.quickstart.md\n└── dendron.zen.md\n```\n\n- dendron.yml\n\n```yml\npublish:\n  siteHierarchies: [dendron]\n```\n\n- published:\n\n```\n.\n└── dendron\n    ├── dendron.quickstart\n    └── dendron.zen\n```\n\n### Examples of CNAME, Github and SEO Options\n\n```yml\nsite:\n    siteHierarchies:\n        - dendron\n    siteRootDir: docs\n    gh_edit_repository: \"https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron-site\"\n    logo: \"vault/assets/images/logo.png\"\n    siteUrl: \"https://dendron.so\"\n    githubCname: \"dendron.so\"\n    title: Dendron\n    author: \"dendronhq\"\n    twitter: \"dendronhq\"\n    description: \"Dendron is a local-first, markdown based, hierarchical note taking tool. It is meant to help you create, organize, and collaborate on knowledge bases of any size.\"\nvaults:\n    - fsPath: vault\n```\n\n## Note Configuration\n\nYou can specify how notes are published via the frontmatter of each note. \n\n### canonicalUrl\n- default: undefined\n\nIf set, adds CANONICAL_URL when publishing\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"CANONICAL_URL\" />\n```\n\n### published\n\n- default: true\n\nTo exclude a page from publication, you can add the following to the frontmatter. If you set `publishByDefault: false` for a hierarchy, this needs to be set to `true` to publish\n\n```yml\n...\npublished: false\n```\n\n### nav_exclude\n\nIf set, do not include the current note in the navigation bar. \n\n### nav_order\n\n- type: number\n\nIf set, denote order that item appears in the published nav bar\n> NOTE: `root` has `nav_order: 1` so the `nav_order` of your denoted items must be superior to 1\n\n### noindex\n\n- default: false\n\nTo tell google to not index a page, you can add the following tag to the frontmatter. You can also have this as a default for a given hierarchy by setting `noIndexByDefault: true` in the site config.\n\n```yml\n...\nnoindex: true\n```\n\n### gitNoLink\n\nDisable git linking for this page\n\n### gitNotePath\n\nWhen set, override how we generate the URL for the [[edit on github|dendron.topic.publishing.features#edit-on-github]] link.\n\nThere are a few special variables you can set:\n\n- `${noteHierarchy}`: this specifies the full hiearchy to the note in posix format\n  - eg. `foo.bar` will translate to `foot/bar`\n\n### collection options\n\n#### has_collection\n\n- default: false\n\nWhether a given page is a collection. A collection doesn't have a table of contents and allows you to set collection specific options. \n> NOTE: Setting this property `has_collection` in the frontmatter of parent note is sufficient.\n\n#### date\n\nIf set, used to designate a custom publication date. By default, use timestamp of `created` field. \n\n#### skipLevels\n\nIf set, determines how many levels of children to skip when making the collection. For example, you might have the following hierarchy. \n\n```\n- blog.md\n- blog.reading.md\n- blog.reading.journal.md\n- blog.reading.journal.2020.md\n- blog.reading.journal.2020.12.md\n- blog.reading.journal.2020.12.20.one.md\n- blog.reading.journal.2020.12.31.two.md\n```\n\nWhen you publish, you might only want to show the leaf nodes and skip the intermediary levels. In the above example, setting `skipLevels: 3` on `blog.reading.md` will result in the following hierarchy being published.\n\n```\n- blog.md\n- blog.reading.md\n- blog.reading.journal.2020.12.20.one.md\n- blog.reading.journal.2020.12.31.two.md\n```\n\n- NOTE: when you set `skipLevels`, this also affects [[children links|dendron.topic.links#children-links]]\n\n#### sort_order\n\n- default: `ascending`\n- values: `ascending|reverse`\n\nSort items in a collection page. Ascending by default. Specify `reverse` to sort in descending order.\n\n### seo options\n\n#### image\n\nSets image url for the page. Shows up in twitter card preview\n\n#### excerpt\n\nSets a custom `og:description` tag for the particular page\n\n## Line Configuration\n\nYou can control publication on a per line basis.\n\n### LOCAL_ONLY_LINE\n\nSometimes, you just want to keep a few lines private while publishing the rest of your vault. You can do that with `Local only`. In order to mark a line as `Local Only`, add the following markdown comment at the end of the line: \n\n```markdown\nHello World!  <!-- Will be published -->\n\n <!-- won't be published -->\n```\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/pod-local.gif)\n\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/f2ed8639-a604-4a9d-b76c-41e205fb8713.html","relUrl":"notes/f2ed8639-a604-4a9d-b76c-41e205fb8713.html"},{"doc":"Collections","title":"Collections","hpath":"dendron.topic.publishing.collections","content":"Sometimes, you might want to publish a page that has all its children listed like in a blog archive format. \n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/publishv2.collection.jpg)\n\nThis format is called a `collection` in Dendron. You can designate that a page be published as a collection by setting the [[has_collection|dendron.topic.publishing.configuration#has_collection]] property in the note frontmatter. \n\nYou can see an example of it [here](https://www.kevinslin.com/notes/e9c72b4f-adb8-4f15-a6aa-9f9d81538561.html).\n\n## Sorting\n\nSorting is by the `created` attribute by default. If you wish to set an override, you can add a `date` attribute in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (eg. `date: '2019-08-08'`)\n\nYou can control sort order via the [[sort_order|dendron.topic.publishing.configuration#sort_order]] attribute.\n\n## Skip Levels\n\n![[dendron.topic.publishing.configuration#skiplevels,1:#*]]\n\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/e4ea4fe3-0350-492e-863a-687d9fc15993.html","relUrl":"notes/e4ea4fe3-0350-492e-863a-687d9fc15993.html"},{"doc":"Changelogs","title":"Changelogs","hpath":"dendron.topic.publishing.changelogs","content":"\n## Summary\n- status: 🚧\n\nDendron can now generate a changelog for your published site.

Due to the fact that the vault will contain work related information, there are certain requirements\n- No public hosting\n- Manually select persons with access\n- If someone leaves the company, he should not have access anymore\n- Low maintenance & management overhead\n\n## Setup\n\n> Remove any comments in the sample configurations, if you want to copy them. They help humans, but machines might not like them.\n\n### Static Web App\n\nSince we are fully commited to MS Azure at this point, [Azure Static Web Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/overview) seem to be a good fit for this. It allows you to simply host static websites an integrate them with your build pipelines az Azure DevOps or GitHub.\n\n1. Create a [new static](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.StaticApp) web app\n1. In the overview, select \"Manage Deployment Token\" and copy it for later\n1. Optional: set a custom domain\n\n### Build pipeline\n\n1. Prepare `package.json` in your repo to contain a proper build script to generate the site.\n    ```json\n    // package.json\n    \"scripts\": {\n        \"build\": \"npx dendron buildSite --stage prod\"\n    },\n    ```\n1. Set up the azure build pipeline for that repo. Mine builds every time something is pushed to the `master` branch.\n    ```yaml\n    // azure-pipelines.yml\n    trigger:\n    - master\n\n    pool:\n    vmImage: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n    - task: AzureStaticWebApp@0\n    inputs:\n        app_location: '/'\n        output_location: 'docs'\n        azure_static_web_apps_api_token: '$(web-app-token)'\n    ```\n    It uses a builder called `Oryx` to automatically detect the project type (via package.json) and calls `npm run build` automatically. I only provided the basic options, if you want, you can override this.\n1. Set up the web-app-token. Edit the pipeline on the DevOps site. Select \"Variables\" and create a new secret variable called `web-app-token`. Paste the token you copied earlier.\n1. Run the pipeline. Your site should now **publically (!)** be available. Let's fix that....\n\n### Securing Access\n\nIn my environment, every potential reader of my vault has an Active Directory account already. This can be leveraged to create route based access control to the vault. By default, Azure AD, GitHub and Twitter authentication [are supported](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/authentication-authorization).\n\n1. At the root of your repository, create a file called `staticwebapp.config.json`. This is a very basic example, more options can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/configuration#example-configuration-file).\n    ```json\n    // staticwebapp.config.json\n    {\n        \"routes\": [\n            {   // redirect /login to the Active Directory endpoint for authentication. \n            \"route\": \"/login\",\n            \"rewrite\": \"/.auth/login/aad\"\n            },\n            {   // Only allow people with the \"reader\" role to access ANY route.\n            \"route\": \"/*\",\n            \"allowedRoles\": [\"reader\"]\n            }    \n        ],\n        \"responseOverrides\": {\n            \"401\": {    // If access is denied because of a missing role (=anonymous users), redirect them to login.\n            \"redirect\": \"/login\",\n            \"statusCode\": 302\n            }\n        },\n        \"globalHeaders\": {\n            \"content-security-policy\": \"default-src https: 'unsafe-eval' 'unsafe-inline'; object-src 'none'\"\n        },\n        \"mimeTypes\": {\n            \".json\": \"text/json\"\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n1. Update `package.json` to copy `staticwebapp.config.json` to the built site\n    ```json\n    // package.json\n    \"scripts\": {\n        \"build\": \"npx dendron buildSite --stage prod && cp staticwebapp.config.json docs/\"\n    },\n    ```\n1. Push all the changes to the repository\n1. Back to the Azure Portal, go to you Static Web App and select \"Role management\"\n1. Click \"Invite\", enter the Email address of a colleague/yourself and set the role to `reader`\n\nAfter logging in using the generated URL, the user will be allowed to access your vault and will appear in role management. You can remove users and reassign roles here.\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/7lVybQm4oETkTUyHRZB0a.html","relUrl":"notes/7lVybQm4oETkTUyHRZB0a.html"},{"doc":"Advanced","title":"Advanced","hpath":"dendron.topic.publishing.advanced","content":"### Exclude from publication\n\nTo exclude a page from publication, you can add the following to the frontmatter.

Tools like Evernote and Roam are pods. Social media services like Twitter and Facebook are pods. Publication destinations like static sites and Medium are pods. Everything is a pod.\n\nPods let you do the following:\n\n- **import** your notes from any existing location into Dendron\n- **export** your notes from Dendron to any existing location\n- **publish** your notes from Dendron to any existing location\n\nTo access pods, Dendron exposes three commands:\n\n- `Dendron: Import Pod`: imports notes \n- `Dendron: Export Pod`: export notes \n- `Dendron: Publish Pod`: publish notes \n\n**NOTE**: not all pods will expose all three commands. Each pod implementation can choose to implement any subset of the three commands. \n\n## Pod Methods\n\n### Import\n\nImporting lets you bulk import notes from a given source and into Dendron. The notes are formatted and converted to Dendron's hierarchal structure.\n\n### Export\n\nExporting lets you bulk export notes from Dendron into another destinations. The notes will be formatted and converted to the native format of the destination. \n\n### Publish\n\nPublishing lets you take one note and output it into a different format/destination. \n\nFor example, you might want to use our [[markdown pod|dendron.topic.pod.builtin.markdown]] to take a note with [[note references|dendron.topic.references]] and publish it as a regular markdown note to use in a github issue or another tool.\n\nFuture uses of the **publish** method will be taking a note and publishing it to social media (eg. twitter, facebook, linkedin), publishing it to Gmail, and publishing to destinations like Medium and dev.to.\n\n## Types of Pods\n\nThere are two types of pods:\n\n- builtin: created by dendron \n- remote: created by third parties\n\n![[dendron.topic.pod.builtin#summary,1:]]\n![[dendron.topic.pod.custom#summary,1:]]\n\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/66727a39-d0a7-449b-a10d-f6c438185d7f.html","relUrl":"notes/66727a39-d0a7-449b-a10d-f6c438185d7f.html"},{"doc":"Sdk Reference","title":"Sdk Reference","hpath":"dendron.topic.pod.sdk","content":"\n\n## PublishPod\n\nBase class to be extended when creating a pod for [[publishing|dendron.topic.pod#publish]]\n\n### plant(opts: PublishPodPlantOpts<T>)\n- opts\n    - engine: DEngineClientV2\n    - config: PublishPodConfig\n    - note: NotePropsV2\n```ts\nexport type NotePropsV2 = {\n  id: string;\n  title: string;\n  desc: string;\n  links: DLink[];\n  fname: string;\n  updated: string;\n  created: string;\n  parent: DNodePointerV2 | null;\n  children: DNodePointerV2[];\n  body: string;\n  custom?: any;\n  schema?: { moduleId: string; schemaId: string };\n  vault: DVault;\n  ...\n};\n```","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/6301a5b4-d88f-4ecd-ad72-0880b1bf14b0.html","relUrl":"notes/6301a5b4-d88f-4ecd-ad72-0880b1bf14b0.html"},{"doc":"Import","title":"Import","hpath":"dendron.topic.pod.import","content":"\nImport pods let you import data from a data source into Dendron\n\n## Configuration\n\n### src\n* description: \"Where to import from\"\n* type: \"string\" as const\n* required: true\n\n### vaultName\n* description: \"name of vault to import into\"\n* type: \"string\" as const\n* required: true\n\n### concatenate\n* description: \"whether to concatenate everything into one note\"\n* type: \"boolean\"\n* default: false\n\nWhen importing, you can either import everything from source as multiple files or concatenate it all together as one file\n\n### frontmatter\n* description: \"frontmatter to add to each note\"\n* type: \"object\"\n\nYou can add custom [[frontmatter|dendron.topic.frontmatter]] to notes as you import them.

Create a symlink of your current package. This lets you use your package locally in other projects\n   ```sh\n   npm link\n   ```\n2. Go to your [[workspace root|dendron.ref.layout#workspace-root]].\n   ```sh\n   cd $WORKSPACE_ROOT\n   ```\n3. If you don't have a `package.json` already , create one by running `npm init -y`\n   ```sh\n   npm init -y\n   ```\n4. Link to your created pod\n   ```sh\n   npm link hello-pod\n   ```\n5. Excecute your pod\n   ```sh\n   dendron-cli publishPod --wsRoot . --podId hello --podPkg hello-pod --podSource custom --config fname=dendron,vaultName=vault,dest=stdout\n   ```\n   - since I was running this in a new Dendron vault, I got the following output.\n   - you can change the value of the fname config to an existing note's file name to run it against that note.\n\n## The Trail 🥾\n\nHere are the basics of Dendron so you can get started growing your knowledge base.\n- [ ] Create your first note.\n    - [ ] Dendron uses the [lookup](https://www.dendron.so/notes/a7c3a810-28c8-4b47-96a6-8156b1524af3.html#lookup-menu) command to create. So, hit CMD+L (or ctrl+L if you're on Windows) to bring up the lookup bar, type in a new note name and hit enter to create it. You can also run the lookup command through the command palette \"Dendron: Lookup\".\n    - [ ] Wiki-style links are supported. If the note doesn't exist, we'll create the note for you. For example, just try [[this link]] from the editor view.\n- [ ] Find your notes. Dendron really shines when you need to look up notes quickly. For this, you use *drumroll* the lookup command (again). Just hit CMD/ctrl+L and you can search your entire set of notes.\n- [ ] To delete a note, navigate to it and use the \"Dendron: Delete Node\" command. As with everything else in VSCode, bring up the command palette with CMD/ctrl+shift+P and run the command.\n- [ ] Use a [snippet](https://www.dendron.so/notes/9eca1992-7540-4d9d-97fb-328b27748b2c.html) for quick note templates\n- [ ] Insert an [image](https://www.dendron.so/notes/a91fd8da-6895-49fe-8164-a17acd8d9a17.html)\n- [ ] Create some [links](https://www.dendron.so/notes/3472226a-ff3c-432d-bf5d-10926f39f6c2.html)\n- [ ] [[Publish|dendron.topic.publishing.selective-publication]] your vault\n- [ ] Join us on [discord](https://discord.com/invite/6j85zNX) and discuss all things knowledge management with your fellow trail blazers.\n- [ ] For more information, see Dendron's basic [concepts](https://www.dendron.so/notes/c6fd6bc4-7f75-4cbb-8f34-f7b99bfe2d50.html)\n```\n\n### Pass in custom configuration values\n\nWe're going to make our publishing a little more dynamoc by using custom configuration. \n\nModify your pod to accept a new configuration parameter\n\n```js\nconst { PublishPod } = require(\"@dendronhq/pods-core\");\n\nclass HelloPod extends PublishPod {\n  static id = \"hello\";\n  static description = \"Add a hello statement\";\n\n  get config() {\n    return super.config.concat([\n      {\n        key: \"name\",\n        description: \"dev.to api key\",\n        type: \"string\",\n      },\n    ]);\n  }\n\n  async plant(opts) {\n    const { note, config } = opts;\n    const body = note.body;\n    return [`Hello ${config.name}`, body].join(\"\\n\");\n  }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  pods: [HelloPod],\n};\n\n```\n\nBelow is a diff to make the changes a bit more obvious.\n![diff of code](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/pod-change.jpg)\n\nRun the pod again the the additional argument.\n\n````\n```sh\ndendron-cli publishPod --wsRoot . --podId hello --podPkg hello-pod --podSource remote --config fname=dendron,vaultName=vault,dest=stdout,name=Albert\n```\n````\n\n```markdown\nHello Albert\n\n## The Trail 🥾\n...\n```\n\n### Use Note Metadata\n\nPods have full access to all the metadata attached to a note.

Progress can be tracked in this [issue](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/286). -->\n\nCustom pods can be developed by anyone ans a `NodeJS` package and used after a user installs it in their workspace. They can be used with either the `dendron-cli` or from within the Dendron extension to import/export/publish your notes from/to anywhere\n\n- NOTE: at the current time, custom pods can only be run using `dendron-cli`. We're working on building them into the plugin within the next couple of weeks\n- NOTE: currently, only custom pods for **publishing** is supported. We're working on adding support for `import` and `export` pods\n\n## Quickstart (Using a custom pod)\n\nRun the following inside your Dendron workspace.\n\n### Install a Pod\n\n```bash\ncd {workspace}\nnpm init -y \nnpm install -g dendron-cli\nnpm install --save {dendron-pod-package}\n```\n\n### Execute a Pod (CLI)\n\n```bash\ndendron-cli publishPod --wsRoot . --podId {podId} --podPkg {npmPkg} --podSource custom --config {podConfig}\n```\n\n## List of Custom Pods\n\n- [[Dev.to Pod|pkg.devto-pod]]: publish notes to dev.to\n\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/6322a2de-34fd-4c93-bcbe-d71c30e5f2b6.html","relUrl":"notes/6322a2de-34fd-4c93-bcbe-d71c30e5f2b6.html"},{"doc":"Builtin Pods","title":"Builtin Pods","hpath":"dendron.topic.pod.builtin","content":"\n## Summary\nBuiltin pods are managed by Dendron and are available when you install Dendron.

For the `vault` parameter, just add a valid vault from your workspace. This pod works a bit differently than other ones, and this is a required parameter that doesn't get used by this pod.\n\n#### Supported Selectors/Properties\n\nThe following selectors are supported from Obsidian:\n\n-   .graph-view.color-fill\n-   .graph-view.color-circle\n-   .graph-view.color-line\n-   .graph-view.color-text\n-   .graph-view.color-fill-highlight\n\nThe following properties are supported:\n\n-   color\n-   opacity\n\nAny CSS rules not covered by the above selectors/properties will be omitted in the final result.\n\n#### Using the Exported File\n\nThe exported style file can be found at `~/.dendron/styles`.

A [uuid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) will be added to non-markdown file names to ensure it does not overwrite any existing files.

Authentication\n1. Choosing Which Document To Import\n1. Choosing the Destination\n\n### Authentication\n\nThere are currently two ways to authenticate - through an OAuth workflow (currently in Beta) and a manual workflow.\n\n#### OAuth Flow (Beta)\n\n_**Note**: This feature is currently in Beta and requires your Google Account to be onboarded to our service. If you're interested in testing out this feature, please contact us at support@dendron.so or on Discord._\n\nAfter getting your Google Account onboarded with us, simply run the GDoc import pod and you'll be redirected to your browser to sign in with your Google Account. Once signed in, your credentials will be saved and you can run the Import Pod again to import your docs.\n\n#### Manual Workflow\n\nTo communicate with the Google Docs, you'll need to manually obtain OAuth token with the right scopes.\nFollow the steps below to create a token. The scopes you require depends on the type of data you're trying to request, you can even select all and you are good to go.\n\n1. Go to [Google Oauth2 Playground](https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground/) and select the `Google Docs API v1` with scope as `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents` and `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive` and click on Authorize APIs button. Authorize yourself by selecting your google account from the oauth popup.\n1. On Step 2 in Oauth2 Playground, click on exchange authorization code for tokens. Copy the access token, refresh token and store it in the  dendron gdoc import pod config file.\n\n### Choosing which Document to Import\n\nThe Pod will automatically query for documents on your Drive and provide you with a drop down list of documents for you to choose to import. Currently, only one file can be imported at a time. If it takes the engine too long to query for your documents (maybe if you have a lot of documents on your drive), then the operation will time out. In this case, you can manually enter the name of the document you want to import.\n\n### Choosing the Destination\n\nThe final prompt in the workflow asks for the destination location of the note to put the gdoc contents in.  By default, the name of the document is populated.  If you import this document repeatedly, then the destination will be pre-populated with the path you picked during the previous import.\n\n\n## Example\n\n- config\n```yml\nsrc: gdoc\nvaultName: vault\nowner: dendronhq\naccessToken: ***\nrefreshToken: ***\nexpirationTime: 1630569771.749\nimportComments: {enable: true, format: text}\nconfirmOverwrite: true\n```\n\n- Original \n```\n└── vault\n    └── projects\n          ├─one.md\n          ├─two.md\n  \n```\n- After\n\n```\n  └── vault\n        ├── projects.one.md\n        ├── projects.two.md\n        └── gdoc.topic.dendron\n\n```\n\n- Imported Doc\n\n```md\n---\ntitle: Dendron\ndocumentId: ***\nrevisionId: ***\n---\n## Dendron\n\nDendron is an **open-source**, **local-first**, **markdown-based**, **note-taking** tool built on top of [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like `#` or `*`.\n\n## Syntax guide\n\n### Headers\n\n```markdown\n# This is an <h1> tag\n\n## This is an <h2> tag\n\n### This is an <h3> tag\n\n#### This is an <h4> tag\n\n##### This is an <h5> tag\n\n###### This is an <h6> tag\n```\n\n### Emphasis\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore -->\n\n```markdown\n*This text will be italic*\n_This will also be italic_\n\n**This text will be bold**\n__This will also be bold__\n\n_You **can** combine them_\n\n~~This text will be strikethrough~~\n```\n\n### Lists\n\n#### Unordered List\n\n```markdown\n- Item 1\n- Item 2\n  - Item 2a\n  - Item 2b\n```\n\n#### Ordered List\n\n```markdown\n1. Item 1\n1. Item 2\n1. Item 3\n   1. Item 3a\n   1. Item 3b\n```\n\n#### Definition List\n\n```markdown\nItem 1\n: Definition for Item 1\n\nItem 2\n~ Definition for Item 2\n~ Another definition for Item 2, with a [link](http://www.example.com)\n```\n\n### Images\n\n```markdown\n![GitHub Logo](/images/logo.png)\nFormat: ![Alt Text](url)\n```\n\n### Links\n\n```markdown\nhttps://github.com - automatic!\n[GitHub](https://github.com)\n```\n\n### Blockquote\n\n```markdown\nAs Kanye West said:\n\n> We're living the future so\n> the present is our past.\n```\n\n### Horizontal Rule\n\n```markdown\nThree or more...\n\n---\n\nHyphens\n\n---\n\nAsterisks\n\n---\n\nUnderscores\n```\n\n### Inline code\n\n```markdown\nI think you should use an\n`<addr>` element here instead.\n```\n\n### Fenced code block\n\nYou can create fenced code blocks by placing triple backticks <code>\\`\\`\\`</code> before and after the code block.\n\n#### Syntax Highlighting\n\nYou can add an optional language identifier to enable syntax highlighting in your fenced code block.\n\nFor example, to syntax highlight Ruby code:\n\n````\n```ruby\nrequire 'redcarpet'\nmarkdown = Redcarpet.new(\"Hello World!\")\nputs markdown.to_html\n```\n````\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'redcarpet'\nmarkdown = Redcarpet.new(\"Hello World!\")\nputs markdown.to_html\n```\n\n### Task lists\n\n```markdown\n- [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)\n- [x] this is a complete item\n- [ ] this is an incomplete item\n```\n\n## Extended Syntax\n\nThese are non-standard markdown syntax used in Dendron. Everything here is both available in Dendron's preview as well as when publishing.\n\n### Tables\n\nYou can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens `-` (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe `|`:\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore -->\n\n```markdown\nFirst Header | Second Header\n------------ | -------------\nContent from cell 1 | Content from cell 2\nContent in the first column | Content in the second column\n```\n\nYou can create a table from existing content using `> Markdown Shortcuts: Add Table` command.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdickin/vscode-markdown-shortcuts/master/media/demo/table_with_header.gif)\n\n### Abbreviation\n\nThe HTML specification\n\n```markdown\n_[HTML]: Hyper Text Markup Language\n_[W3C]: World Wide Web Consortium\nThe HTML specification\nis maintained by the W3C.\n```\n\n### Footnotes\n\n```markdown\nContent [^1]\n\n[^1]: Hi! This is a footnote\n```\n\n### Frontmatter Variable Substitution\n\nYou can use variables defined in your note frontmatter inside your note. The syntax is `{{fm.VAR_NAME}}` where `VAR_NAME` is the name of your variable. The `fm` designates that you want to use a frontmatter variable. \n\n### Nunjuck Templates\n- status: EXPERIMENTAL\n\nYou can use a limited set of [nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) to customize your notes. \n\nTo enable, you can set the following to true inside your `dendron.yml`.\n```yml\nuseNunjucks: true\n```\n\nOnce enabled, you'll have access to nunjucks specific constructs. You'll have the same variables available as during [[frontmatter variable substitution|dendron.topic.markdown#frontmatter-variable-substitution]]. Nunjucks templates also get access to the `fname` builtin variable which will be substituted with the filename of the current note. \n\nBelow is an example of what you can do with nunjucks.\n\n- Raw Markdown\n```md\n## Variables\n\n- special variables: {{fname}}\n- special variable as link: [[{{fname}}]]\n- special variable as note ref: ![[{{fname}}#footer]]\n\n## Loops\n\n{% for item in fm.alist %}\n\n- Item: {{item}}\n  {% endfor %}\n\n## Footer\n\nThis is some footer content\n```\n\n- Compiled \n![nunjucks example](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/topic.nunjucks.jpg)\n\n\nNunjucks will work for both the preview and for publishing. It is still an experimental feature which means it might change in backwards in-compatible ways at any point.\n\nIt currently also has the following limitations:\n- disables live preview of markdown (you'll need to refresh the markdown to see changes)\n- will throw an error if you currently have nunjucks like strings inside your notes `eg. {% %}`\n- will throw errors if you refer to an undefined variable `{{ foo }}` \n\n### Diagrams \n\nDendron lets you create Diagrams using [mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/)\nCreate a code block with mermaid support to use mermaid. The following block turns into the diagram below.\n\n<pre>\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A-->B;\n    A-->C;\n    B-->D;\n    C-->D;\n```\n</pre>\n\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A-->B;\n    A-->C;\n    B-->D;\n    C-->D;\n```\n\n- NOTE: in order to publish diagrams, you'll need to enable [[mermaid in the config|dendron.topic.config.dendron#mermaid-optional]]\n\n### Folding\nYou can create special folded sections with the below syntax.\n\n```\n<details>\n  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>\n  \n  ## Heading\n  1. A numbered\n  2. list\n     * With some\n     * Sub bullets\n</details>\n```\nThis is how it looks\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>\n  \n  ## Heading\n  1. A numbered\n  2. list\n     * With some\n     * Sub bullets\n</details>\n\n## VSCode Specific Commands\n\n### Markdown Smart Select\n\nThis allows you to expand and shrink selections of markdown using a keyboard shortcut.\n\n- Expand: ⌃⇧⌘→\n- Shrink: ⌃⇧⌘←\n\nSelection applies to the following, and follows a traditional hierarchical pattern:\n\n- Headers\n- Lists\n- Block quotes\n- Fenced code blocks\n- Html code blocks\n- Paragraphs\n\n![preview](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/updates/1_51/markdown-smart-select-demo.gif)\n\n> Image by Microsoft\n\n## Compatibility with CommonMark\n\n[CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/) is _a strongly defined, highly compatible specification of Markdown_\n\nWhen possible, Dendron will try to stay to `CommonMark` spec for syntax. That being said, many of the features we have (eg. block based note references) have no common mark equivalent which is why we've had to invent new syntax.\n\nYou can use the [[markdown pod|dendron.topic.pod.builtin.markdown]] to migrate both individual notes and your entire vault to a CommonMark compatible format.\n\n## Other Resources\n\n- [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)\n- [Daring Fireball: Markdown Basics](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics)\n- [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/)\n\n## References\n\nThe content of this page is derived from the following sources:\n\n1.

Lookups help you create, find, and organize your notes. You can watch the following video to see some of the things you can do with lookups.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/a409a621763548d395e48c9d4380cbe7\"><img style=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/a409a621763548d395e48c9d4380cbe7-1600813345789-with-play.gif\"> </a>\n\n## Lookups\nDendron supports look ups by keywords separated by spaces/' ' without having to know the order where the keywords occur in the note. As example: `dendron rename` & `rename dendron` will both match note `dendron.dev.design.commands.rename`.\n\nAs mentioned in [[Details|dendron.topic.lookup#details]], the look up is accomplished through utilization of [fusejs](https://fusejs.io/). You can use [fusejs extended search](https://fusejs.io/examples.html#extended-search) syntax when looking up notes.  \n\nFor entries that have the same score, Dendron will sort results by their last updated time.\n\n## Details\n\nBehind the scenes, lookup uses [fusejs](https://fusejs.io/) to do fuzzy string matching based on the note hierarchy. You can see our parameters [here](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/common-all/src/fuse.ts#L31).\n\nScoring is explained [here](https://fusejs.io/concepts/scoring-theory.html).\n\nYou can see the pseudo code for how fusejs integrates with lookup [[here|pkg.dendron-plugin.t.lookup.internal]].\n\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/a7c3a810-28c8-4b47-96a6-8156b1524af3.html","relUrl":"notes/a7c3a810-28c8-4b47-96a6-8156b1524af3.html"},{"doc":"Schemas","title":"Schemas","hpath":"dendron.topic.lookup.schemas","content":"Dendron also provides lookup for [[schemas|dendron.topic.schema]].

At this point, you are free to edit the schema. After you're satisfied with the result, you'll need to run [[Dendron: Reload Index|dendron.topic.commands]] for it to take affect. \n\n- NOTE: if you get an error after running `Reload Index`, it is most likely because your YAML is malformed.

Use them as a starting point to customize various flavors of lookup to your liking.\n\nPlease refer to the [official documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings) about setting key bindings for a full reference.\n\n### Lookup with a frequently used initial value.\n\nIf you find yourself looking up a certain hierarchy a lot, it could be useful to set a keybinding that will automatically prefill the initial value with the frequently used hierarchy:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    ...\n  },\n  { // lookup `recipe.` hierarchy\n    \"key\": \"alt+l r\",\n    \"command\": \"dendron.lookupNote\",\n    \"args\": {\n      \"initialValue\": \"recipe.\"\n    }\n  },\n  { // lookup `meeting.{journal-format}.` hierarchy\n    \"key\": \"alt+l m\",\n    \"command\": \"dendron.lookupNote\",\n    \"args\": {\n      \"initialValue\": \"meet\",\n      \"noteType\": \"journal\"\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    ...\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Open a fixed note that you reference a lot to the side.\n\nIf you have a note that has a fixed hierarchy that you frequently look up while working on other notes, it is useful to have it open to the side (horizontal split) so that you can read it at the same time.\n\nFor example, one could have a single todo list that they use as a source of truth for everything that they need to do. (We are assuming this is the single file that holds all todo items.)\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    ...\n  },\n  { // open the note `todo` to the side, without confirmation.\n    \"key\": \"alt+l 0\",\n    \"command\": \"dendron.lookupNote\",\n    \"args\": {\n      \"initialValue\": \"todo\",\n      \"splitType\": \"horizontal\",\n      \"noConfirm\": true\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    ...\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Look up a note that you want to reference in another note, open it to the side.\n\nWhen working on a note, you may want to reference another note by adding a link to it.\nYou may also want to read through that reference beforehand.\n\nIn this case, it may be useful to open the note you want to reference to the side, and also automatically copy the note link to the clipboard so that you can seamlessly go back to your original note and insert it.\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    ...\n  },\n  { // look up note, then open it to the side. also copy selected note's link.\n    \"key\": \"alt+l .\",\n    \"command\": \"dendron.lookupNote\",\n    \"args\": {\n      \"splitType\": \"horizontal\",\n      \"copyNoteLink\": true\n    }\n  },\n  { // same as above, but with multi select.\n    \"key\": \"alt+l >\",\n    \"command\": \"dendron.lookupNote\",\n    \"args\": {\n      \"splitType\": \"horizontal\",\n      \"copyNoteLink\": true,\n      \"multiSelect\": true\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    ...\n  }\n]\n```\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/ad270a7d-2aed-4273-8319-eb6536e38b29.html","relUrl":"notes/ad270a7d-2aed-4273-8319-eb6536e38b29.html"},{"doc":"Keybindings","title":"Keybindings","hpath":"dendron.topic.lookup.keybindings","content":"You can trigger specific lookups using custom key bindings.

These notes can be created by toggling the corresponding **note button**  on the lookup menu or by using the respective builtin shortcuts.\n\n- values:\n  - none (default): create a regular note\n  - journal: create a journal note (cmd/ctrl + shift + j)\n  - scratch: create a scratch note (cmd/ctrl + shift + s)\n\n## Creating Notes with a Selection\n\nIf you have text highlighted while creating a new note with a lookup, the new note will be created using the text selected.

The `Markdown Shortcuts: Toggle hyperlink` command makes this operation really easy. You can even bind this to a shortcut key combination. We'd recommend using 'cmd/ctrl + K' to get the usual application behavior or 'cmd/ctrl + U' if you want to continue using ctrl+k as part of the usual VSCode combo operation.\n\n## Wiki Links\n\nWiki links support **autocomplete**. To initiate:\n\n- create wikilink brackets and start typing\n- link to specific sections of notes using the `[[wiki link#header]]` syntax.\n  - NOTE: relative links will not go to the anchor if clicked on the preview, in that case, it becomes a normal link to the file\n  - NOTE2: doesn't work when exported through a pod\n- use the vscode [intellisense shortcut](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense#_key-bindings) to trigger the autocomplete\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/links-autocomplete.gif)\n\n### Highlights\n\nWiki links also have support for highlighting in the editor. Existing notes will be highlighted in blue, and missing notes will be highlighted in yellow. The exact shade of color depends on your theme.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/aBcgyZX.png)\n\n## Children Links\n\nWhen you [[publish|dendron.topic.publishing]] your notes, Dendron shows all children of the note at the bottom.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/Quickstart_-_Dendron.jpg)\n\n## Backlinks\n\nBacklinks are links that point to the current note. \n\n### Types of Backlinks\nThere are currently two types of backlinks available in the Backlinks view: `Linked` and `Candidates`. \n\n#### Linked Backlink\n`Linked` backlinks are regular [[wiki links|dendron.topic.links#wiki-links]] that are pointing to the current note.\n\n- NOTE: The link candidate feature of the backlinks panel is currently disabled by default. 'Accessing the Backlinks view' section below goes over how to enable it.\n\n#### Candidate Backlink\n`Candidate` backlinks are plain text words that match the name of the current note, which can potentially be converted into a (linked) backlink.\n\n### Backlink View\n\nDendron has a [[backlinks panel|dendron.topic.workbench#backlinks]] which shows all notes with links to the current note. This will also show up underneath [[children Links|dendron.topic.links#children-links]] on published pages.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/links.backlink.jpg)\n\nYou can find further documentation about it [[here|dendron.topic.workbench#backlinks-view]]\n\n## Other Links\n\nFor links to a file format Dendron does not support, you can highlight the link and use `> Dendron: Open Link` to open the file using your operating system default for that file. This also applies to opening paths to folders.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/01250485e20a4cdca2a053dd6047ac68\"><img src=\"https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/01250485e20a4cdca2a053dd6047ac68-with-play.gif\"> </a>\n\n## Cross Vault Links\n\nCross vault links are a way of exactly specifying a note in a [[multi vault|dendron.topic.vaults.multi-vault]] workspace. You can turn a regular link into a cross vault link by adding `dendron://$vaultName/` prefix where `$vaultName` is the [[name|dendron.topic.config.dendron#name]] of your vault.\n\nSome examples:\n\n- regular wiki link: `[[dendron://vault/foo]]`\n- wiki link with alias: `[[Foo Note|dendron://vault/foo]]`\n- relative link: `[[Foo Note|dendron://vault/foo#header1]]`\n\nYou can also use cross vault links for [[note references|dendron.topic.references]].\n\n- note ref: `![[dendron://vault/foo]]`\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/3472226a-ff3c-432d-bf5d-10926f39f6c2.html","relUrl":"notes/3472226a-ff3c-432d-bf5d-10926f39f6c2.html"},{"doc":"Keybindings","title":"Keybindings","hpath":"dendron.topic.keybindings","content":"\n## Summary\nDendron uses VSCode [keybinding](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings) functionality to define its own keybindings. \n\nTo update your keybindings, open the command prompt and type `Open Keyboard Shortcuts`.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/fec07d11a8d949dd98c9ce2ce0bda507\"> \n<img style=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/fec07d11a8d949dd98c9ce2ce0bda507-with-play.gif\"> </a>\n\nIf you prefer to work with JSON, you can use `Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)`.\n\nYou can read more about keybinding syntax [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings)\n\n# Tips\n\n### Add, Reset and Remove\n\n- Add: Every command in VSCode can be bound to a keybinding, even if it doesn't have one\n- Reset: If you want to go back to a default binding, reset it\n- Remove: If you don't use an existing binding, you can remove it\n\n<a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/ec107e7c70f94070b9a4f52dd88b0899\"> \n<img style=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/ec107e7c70f94070b9a4f52dd88b0899-with-play.gif\"> </a>\n\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/c8e99b84-8a5a-42d3-838d-3d5cdebf32e5.html","relUrl":"notes/c8e99b84-8a5a-42d3-838d-3d5cdebf32e5.html"},{"doc":"Images","title":"Images","hpath":"dendron.topic.images","content":"## Copy & Paste\n\nDendron automatically inserts images in your clipboard using the `> Paste Image` command.

This can allow you to display an image at a specific size, make it float\n(text wrapping around image), add a border, or much more. Extended images work both in [[Preview V2|dendron.topic.commands#show-preview-v2]] and in [[Publishing|dendron.topic.publishing]].\n\n### Syntax\n\nExtended images are the same as regular images, except that you add CSS properties at the end of it using an inline YAML map. This is simpler than it sounds, it looks like this:\n\n```\n![alt text (on mouse over)](/assets/image.png){width: 400px}\n```\n\nAt the simplest, this can let you limit the width of the image. You can both set it to a fixed size like `400px`, or a ratio like `50%`.\n\n### Examples\n\n#### Sizing\n\nYou can control the size of the image using `width` and `max-width` properties. `width` sets a fixed size for it, and `max-width` will set the maximum size but will allow smaller sizes (for example, on mobile). For example:\n\n![](/assets/images/2020-09-13-08-45-00.png){max-width: 300px}\n\nThe code for this is:\n```\n![](/assets/images/2020-09-13-08-45-00.png){max-width: 300px}\n```\n\n#### Centering\n\nThis image will be smaller, and will be centered in the page.\n\n![](/assets/images/2020-09-13-08-45-00.png){max-width: 300px, display: block, margin: 0 auto}\n\nThe code for it looks like this:\n```\n![](/assets/images/2020-09-13-08-45-00.png){max-width: 300px, display: block, margin: 0 auto}\n```\n\n#### Float & Border\n\n![](/assets/images/2020-09-13-08-45-00.png){width: 20%, opacity: 0.7, float: right, margin: 20px, border: 5px solid black}\n\nThis image should be floating on the right, allowing text to wrap around it. It will be slightly translucent, and will have a black border around it. The code for it looks like this:\n```\n![](/assets/images/2020-09-13-08-45-00.png){width: 20%, opacity: 0.7, float: right, margin: 20px, border: 5px solid black}\n```\n\n#### Transform\n\n![](/assets/images/2020-09-13-08-45-00.png){width: 20%, float: left, margin: 2rem 10px, transform: \"perspective(150px) rotateY(30deg)\"}\n\nThis image should be floating to the left, and should have a 3-D effect on it! The code for it looks like this:\n```\n![](/assets/images/2020-09-13-08-45-00.png){width: 20%, float: left, margin: 2rem 10px, transform: \"perspective(150px) rotateY(30deg)\"}\n```\n\nOne important thing in this example is the `transform: \" ... \"` part. Note the quotes: they are optional in most cases, but in complex cases they might be required. We don't have anything to warn you if your YAML is broken for now, but you can check the Preview V2, and the previewed image won't apply the CSS if it's broken.\n\n### Allowed CSS properties\n\nFor safety reasons, Dendron doesn't allow you to set just any CSS property. Here's a list of ones that are allowed:\n\n- width, min-width, max-width\n- height, min-height, max-height\n- float\n- border\n- margin\n- padding\n- opacity\n- outline\n- rotate\n- transition\n- transform\n- transform-origin\n- z-index\n\nIf these aren't enough for you, let us know by [sending a feature request](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/new/choose) and we'll add it.","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/a91fd8da-6895-49fe-8164-a17acd8d9a17.html","relUrl":"notes/a91fd8da-6895-49fe-8164-a17acd8d9a17.html"},{"doc":"Hooks","title":"Hooks","hpath":"dendron.topic.hooks","content":"\n## Summary\n- [[API|dendron.topic.hooks.api#^bPnv52_x]]\n- [[Experimental 🧪|dendron.ref.status#experimental-🧪]]\n\nHooks allow users to attach custom scripts to various parts of Dendron's lifecycle.\n\n## Use Cases\n- carry over all your uncompleted todos from one note to the next\n- pull in the weather report in your daily journal note\n- automatically add citations to all images in a note on save\n\n## Related\n- [[9 Note Lifecycle Hooks|dendron.rfc.9-note-lifecycle-hooks]]","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/12551d19-04c2-4d26-ac1e-d23ff3181a9c.html","relUrl":"notes/12551d19-04c2-4d26-ac1e-d23ff3181a9c.html"},{"doc":"Troubleshooting","title":"Troubleshooting","hpath":"dendron.topic.hooks.troubleshooting","content":"\n## Errors\n\n### NoteProps is undefined\n- cause: a hook function isn't returning a valid `{note}` object. make sure your returning a dictionary instead of simply `note`\n- fix: inspect your hook function and make sure its returning a `{note}` object\n\n### hook X has missing script\n- cause: you defined a hook without a script\n- fix: create a script for your hook function in `hooks/{script}.js`\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/be12c6a8-14d4-4a10-ae28-d8e0bb78397d.html","relUrl":"notes/be12c6a8-14d4-4a10-ae28-d8e0bb78397d.html"},{"doc":"Quickstart","title":"Quickstart","hpath":"dendron.topic.hooks.quickstart","content":"\n## Setup\n\nTo create a hook, run [[Hook Create|dendron.topic.commands#hook-create]].

This is the `root.md`. \n\n### Domain\n\nThe domain is the root of a specific hierarchy. In our example vault, we have one domain - `dendron`.\n\n## Why Hierarchies?\n\nDendron is built around hierarchies and the axiom that a canonical hierarichal representation of notes is one of the most effective ways of managing large numbers of notes. You can read more about the thoughts behind this [here](https://www.kevinslin.com/notes/127a3230-4484-433a-b97f-178679564207.html).\n\n## What's with the `.`'s?\n\n1. It allows each **file** to also be a **folder**. This means your notes can have data but also contain other notes. \n2. It makes it much easier to perform certain refactoring operations. For example, say you had the following [[schema|dendron.topic.schema]]\n   ```yml\n   - id: a-parent\n   children:\n       - child-a\n       - child-b\n   - id: child-a\n   - id: child-b\n   ```\n   Lets say you wanted to make `child-b` a child of `child-a`\n   ```yml\n   - id: a-parent\n   children:\n       - child-a\n   - id: child-a\n   children:\n       - child-b\n   - id: child-b\n   ```\n    With the classical folder hierarchy, you would need to turn `child-a` into a folder and then create a custom file to hold the content from the original `child-a`\n   ```\n   .\n   └── a-parent\n       └── child-a\n           ├── child-a-note\n           └── child-b\n   ```\n    With the `.` delimited hierarchy, this becomes a simple rename operation\n   ```\n   .\n   ├── a-parent.child-a\n   └── a-parent.child-a.child-b\n   ```\n3. It allows us to create [[stubs|dendron.topic.schema]] for parts of the hierarchy that don't exist and not clutter our file system with empty folders. With the classical folder hierarchy\n   ```\n   .\n   └── a-parent\n       └── child-a\n           └── grandchild-a\n               └── great-grandchild-a.md\n   ```\n   With the `.` delimited hierarchy\n   ```\n   .\n   └── a-parent.child-a.grandchild-a.great-grandchild-a.md\n   ```\n\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/f3a41725-c5e5-4851-a6ed-5f541054d409.html","relUrl":"notes/f3a41725-c5e5-4851-a6ed-5f541054d409.html"},{"doc":"Graph View","title":"Graph View","hpath":"dendron.topic.graph-view","content":"\n## Summary\n\n-   Visualize the notes and schemas in your workspace in a graph view\n-   Click on a node to open up the corresponding note/schema in your workspace\n-   Filter graph view to show only desired data\n-   Much faster startup times than the legacy note/schema graph\n    -   Scales to virtually any size graph\n\n## Types\n\n### Note Graph\n\n#### Full Note Graph\n\nShow graph of all your notes. You can activate this by using the [[Show Note Graph Command|dendron.topic.graph-view#show-note-graph-v2]] command and toggling the [[Show Note Graph|dendron.topic.graph-view#^Ev8p1L5P0IzDGjAs]] option.\n\n<!-- TODO: pic -->\n\n#### Local Note Graph\n\nShows a graph of your current note and immediate neighbors. This is the default view when you run [[Show Note Graph|dendron.topic.graph-view#show-note-graph-v2]].\n\n<!-- TODO: pic -->\n\n### Schema Graph\n\nShow graph of your schemas. You can activate by running the [[Show Schema Graph|dendron.topic.graph-view#show-schema-graph-v2]] command.\n\n## Commands\n\n### Show Note Graph V2\n\nLaunch the command palette (see [[docs|dendron.guides.cook#launch-the-command-palette]]): `> Dendron: Show Note Graph V2`\n\nClick on a node to open up the corresponding note in your workspace, or open a note to center the graph on that note.\n\nUse the filter view in the top left to filter and modify the data shown by the graph.\n\n### Show Schema Graph V2\n\nLaunch the command palette (see [[docs|dendron.guides.cook#launch-the-command-palette]]): `> Dendron: Show Schema Graph V2`\n\nClick on a node to open up the corresponding schema in your workspace.\n\nUse the filter view in the top left to filter and modify the data shown by the graph.\n\nThe schema graph shows high level connections between a vault's `root` schema and other schemas within the vault. These other schemas may have other nodes connected to them representing additional children of that schema.\n\n## Filter View\n\nIn the top left of both the note and schema graphs lives the graph filter view. This UI element contains information about the graph and various filtering options.\n\n### Vaults\n\nThis view contains a list of each vault in the workspace. The visibility of each vault in the graph can be toggled to better filter the graph.\n\n### Connections\n\n-   **Hierarchy:** When checked, include hierarchical graph connections\n-   **Links:** When checked, include linked note connections\n\n### Filter\n\nThis view contains various options to filter the graph.\n\n#### String Filters\n\nUse these string filters to include/exclude graph nodes by filename or name. These fields support multiple arguments in the form of a comma-separated or space-separated list.\n\n-   **Allowlist**: Graph nodes including any of these string arguments will be **included** in the graph\n-   **Blocklist**: Graph nodes including any of these string arguments will be **excluded** from the graph\n\nHere's a quick example:\n\n-   Allow: `journal.2021, dog`\n    -   Include any notes that include either `journal.2021` or `dog` in their name or filename\n-   Block: `cat`\n    -   Exclude any notes with `cat` in their name or filename\n\n#### Other Filters\n\n-   **Show Stubs**: When checked, show stub notes in the graph\n\n### Options\n\n-   **Show Local Graph (Note Only)**: When checked, show local graph centered around the current open note. Otherwise, show the full workspace-wide note graph. ^Ev8p1L5P0IzDGjAs\n\n-   **Allow Relayout**: When checked, layout the graph again when the graph configuration is updated.\n    -   This is useful in instances you'd like to preserve the current layout but add/remove information, e.g. adding link connections to a hierarchical graph while maintaining readability\n\n### Information\n\nPrimarily for debugging, this section has information about graph size. Edge counts are calculated individually from the actual rendered edges, so may not represent the true rendered count if a certain type of edge is hidden.\n\n-   **Linked Edges**: Number of linked connections between nodes\n-   **Hierarchical Edges**: Number of hierarchical connections between nodes\n-   **Nodes**: Number of nodes in the graph\n\n## Config\n\nGraph configuration is nested under the `graph` object.\n\nSee example below\n\n```yml\ngraph:\n    zoomSpeed: 1 # The speed at which the graph zooms in and out. Lower is slower, higher is faster.\n```\n\n### Zoom Speed\n\n-   type: number\n-   default: 1\n\nThe speed at which the graph zooms in and out. Lower is slower, higher is faster.\n\n## Custom Styling\n\nDendron supports custom styling of schema and note graphs. Styling follows the Cytoscape.js format, which is CSS-like with a couple of differences. [Full Cytoscape.js styling documentation can be found here.](https://js.cytoscape.org/#style)\n\n### Adding Styles\n\nLaunch the command palette (see [[docs|dendron.guides.cook#launch-the-command-palette]]): `> Dendron: Configure Graph Style (css)`\n\nOnce the `styles.css` file is open, add your styles and save. The styles will be visible in the graph the next time it is opened.\n\n> If you're migrating from Obsidian, see [[dendron.topic.pod.builtin.obsidian-style]].\n\n### Selectors\n\nIn order to style the graph, there are a variety of selectors to choose from. Currently supported selectors include:\n\n| Selector     | Description                             |\n| ------------ | --------------------------------------- |\n| `node`       | Any node                                |\n| `edge`       | Any edge                                |\n| `:selected`  | Any selected node                       |\n| `.parent`    | Any parent node (local note graph only) |\n| `.links`     | Any link connection edge                |\n| `.hierarchy` | Any hierarchy connection edge           |\n\nThere are also some vault-specific selectors. These include:\n\n| Selector            | Description                                |\n| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |\n| `.vault-VAULT_NAME` | Any node or edge in the `VAULT_NAME` vault |\n\nSelectors can be chained together, just like in regular CSS. For example, `node.vault-VAULT_NAME` would target only nodes in the `VAULT_NAME` vault.\n\n### Style Properties\n\n#### Styling Nodes\n\nSome common node style properties are listed below.\n**[Full node style property list →](https://js.cytoscape.org/#style/node-body)**\n\n| Property           | Description                                            |\n| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `width`            | The width of the node’s body.                          |\n| `height`           | The height of the node’s body.                         |\n| `shape`            | The shape of the node's body (ellipse, triangle, etc.) |\n| `background-color` | The color of the node's body.                          |\n| `border-width`     | The size of the node’s border.                         |\n| `border-color`     | The color of the node’s border.                        |\n\n#### Styling Node Labels\n\nSome common node label style properties are listed below. Select labels by selecting the node associated with them.\n**[Full node label style property list →](https://js.cytoscape.org/#style/labels)**\n\n| Property      | Description                        |\n| ------------- | ---------------------------------- |\n| `color`       | The color of the label.            |\n| `font-size`   | The size of the label text.        |\n| `font-weight` | The font weight of the label text. |\n\n#### Styling Edges\n\nSome common edge style properties are listed below.\n**[Full edge style property list →](https://js.cytoscape.org/#style/edge-line)**\n\n| Property     | Description                                                  |\n| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `width`      | The width of the edge line.                                  |\n| `line-color` | The color of the edge line.                                  |\n| `line-style` | The style of the edge line (`solid`, `dotted`, or `dashed`). |\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\nIf styles are not showing up in the graph, try the following steps:\n\n1. Check that every style property ends in a semi-colon.\n2. Check that you have no unused selectors (e.g. `node {}`). Cytoscape can be a bit particular at times, so just comment out selectors if not in use.\n3. Close and re-open the graph view. Styles only apply on graph open at the moment.\n\n## RFCs\n\n-   [[7 Graph Rework|dendron.rfc.7-graph-rework]]\n\n---\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/587e6d62-3c5b-49b0-aedc-02f62f0448e6.html","relUrl":"notes/587e6d62-3c5b-49b0-aedc-02f62f0448e6.html"},{"doc":"Git","title":"Git","hpath":"dendron.topic.git","content":"\nGit is the preferred version control system because it integrates with VSCode and GitHub. \n\nThe most likely case is you have a local repository that you need to now add to Git.

VSCode ships with an extension that manages [Git source control support](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol). \n> Note: VSCode uses your computer's Git installation, so you need to [install Git](https://git-scm.com/download) first before you get these features. Make sure you install at least version 2.0.0.\n2. Open your local Dendron workspace. \n> Note: If you are new to Git, the [gt-scm website](https://git-scm.com/doc) is a good place to start, with a popular [online book](https://git-scm.com/book), [Getting Started](https://git-scm.com/video/what-is-git) videos and [cheat sheets](https://github.github.com/training-kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf).

By default, we add the following keys to a new note created with Dendron:\n\n-   id: a globally unique identifier for the note\n-   title: your note title. Used to label nodes in [[graph view|dendron.topic.graph-view]]\n-   desc: optional description about your note.

You can configure a starting hierarchy for this command. Useful if you designated a hierarchy (eg. `templates`) for insertions.\n\nWhen inserting a note, all snippet [[variables|dendron.topic.snippets#variables]] will also be resolved.\n\n- configuration: [[defaultInsertHierarchy|dendron.topic.config.dendron#defaultinserthierarchy]]\n\n### Insert Note Link\n\nInsert the note link into the current document using lookup.\n\nThere are two modifiers that can be passed into this command:\n1. `multiSelect`\n1. `aliasMode`\n\n#### multiSelect\nThis modifier enables the multi-select mode.\nWith multi-select enabled, you can select all the notes you want the links to be inserted.\n\nThis can be toggled on by clicking on the <svg width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" fill=\"currentColor\"><path d=\"M3 3v10h10V3H3zm9 9H4V4h8v8z\"/></svg> button, or setting `multiSelect: true` in `dendron.yml` as below:\n\n  ```yaml\n  ...\n  insertNoteLink:\n    multiSelect: true\n  ...\n  ```\n\nYou can also pass it as a command argument through a custom keybinding as below:\n\n  ```json\n  /* in keybindings.json. \n  * Use `Preference: Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)` to open.\n  */ \n  [\n    ...\n    {\n      \"key\": \"{desired keybinding}\",\n      \"command\": \"dendron.insertNoteLink\",\n      \"args\": {\n        \"multiSelect\": true\n      }\n    },\n    ...\n  ]\n  ```\n\n#### aliasMode\nThis modifier enables different alias modes.\n\nHere is the list of available alias modes:\n1. `snippet`: Inserted note link resolves into a VSCode snippet string\n1. `selection`: Extracts the selection of the active note and use it as the alias.\n1. `title`: Use the note title of the linked note as alias.\n1. `prompt`: Open an input box that will prompt for an input for the alias.\n1. `none`: Does not add alias. (default)\n\nYou can override the default alias mode in `dendron.yml` as below:\n\n```yaml\n// dendron.yml\ninsertNoteLink:\n  aliasMode: \"snippet\" // choose one from the list\n```\n\nYou can also pass it as a command argument through a custom keybinding as below:\n\n  ```json\n  /* in keybindings.json. \n  * Use `Preference: Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)` to open.\n  */ \n  [\n    ...\n    {\n      \"key\": \"{desired keybinding}\",\n      \"command\": \"dendron.insertNoteLink\",\n      \"args\": {\n        \"aliasMode\": \"snippet\" // choose one from the list\n      }\n    },\n    ...\n  ]\n  ```\n\n##### snippet\nInserted note link will resolve into a [VSCode snippet](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets) in the form of\n\n`[[{$1: alias}|note-name]]$0`\n\nIf multi-select is enabled, each subsequent alias field will be available as separate tabstops like so:\n\n```\n[[{$1: alias}|note1]]\n[[{$2: alias}|note1]]\n[[{$3: alias}|note1]]\n[[{$4: alias}|note1]]\n[[{$5: alias}|note1]]\n...\n[[{$n: alias}|note1]]$0\n```\n\n##### selection\nSelection present in the active editor will be extracted and used as the alias.\n\nThe original selection will be replaced by the link inserted.\n\nIf multi-select is enabled, all inserted note links will have identical aliases.\n\n##### title\nThe title of the note that is being linked is used as the link's alais.\n\n##### prompt\nAn input box will be prompted that will let you type in the desired alias.\n\nIf multi-select is enabled, you will be prompted for each of the note links you want to insert.\n\n##### none\nNo alias will be used for the inserted note link(s).\n\n### Insert Note Index\n\nInsert a block that lists the direct children of the current note to cursor position.\n\nThe format of the block is as follows:\n```md\n## Index\n- [[{ch1}|{noteName}]]\n...\n```\n\nIf used in a multi-vault workspace and [[noXVaultWikiLink|dendron.topic.config.dendron#noxvaultwikilink]] is not set, the wikilinks will have a vault prefix added to avoid ambiguity.\n\nGiven the following hierarchy:\n```\n├── recipe\n├── recipe.eggs\n├── recipe.eggs.royale\n├── recipe.eggs.deviled\n├── recipe.eggs.benedict\n├── recipe.eggs.florentine\n├── recipe.bagel \n├── recipe.bagel.with-gravlax\n├── recipe.chicken\n└── recipe.chicken.curry\n```\n\nRunning this command with the note `recipe` open will insert the following at cursor position:\n\n```md\n## Index\n- [[Eggs|recipe.eggs]]\n- [[Bagel|recipe.bagel]]\n- [[Chicken|recipe.chicken]]\n```\n\nRunning it in the note `recipe.eggs` will insert the following at cursor position:\n\n```md\n## Index\n- [[Royale|recipe.eggs.royale]]\n- [[Deviled|recipe.eggs.deviled]]\n- [[Benedict|recipe.eggs.benedict]]\n- [[Florentine|recipe.eggs.florentine]]\n```\n\n- configuration : [[insertNoteIndex|dendron.topic.config.dendron#insertnoteindex]]\n\n### Move Note\n\nMove a note. Also includes option to move a note between vaults\n\n### Paste Link\n\nTransform URL in clipboard to nicely formatted markdown link\n\n### Random Note\n\nNavigates to a random note in the workspace. By default, all notes are included in the set that can be navigated to with this command. This can be adjusted with the `randomNote` setting in the Dendron Config (see [[Configure (yaml)|dendron.topic.commands#configure-yaml]]).\n\n```yaml\n# Sample configuration in dendron.yml:\nrandomNote:\n    include:\n        - alpha\n        - beta.foo\n    exclude:\n        - alpha.bar\n```\n\nThis pattern would specify a set including all notes under `alpha` _except_ for notes in the alpha.bar hierarchy. The set would also include notes under `beta.foo*`.\n\n- If `include` is not specified, then the `include` matching pattern will match all notes.\n- `exclude` takes precedence over `include`, so if the patterns are identical, no notes will match.\n\n### Rename Note\n\n- shortcuts: none\n\nRename a note and all backlinks.\n\nIf the title is the same as what Dendron would autogenerate (kebab-case capitalized), then refactor will change the title as well. Otherwise, it will preserve the existing title.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/command-rename.gif)\n\n### Rename Header\n\n-   shortcuts: none\n\nRename the selected header.\n\nYou must put the caret on the header you want to rename.\nAll wikilinks that link to this header (like `[[note#header]]`) will automatically get updated to the new header.\n\n### Show Preview\n\n- shortcuts:\n  - windows: `windows+ctrl+p`\n  - mac: `cmd+ctrl+p`\n\nShow Markdown Preview\n\n\n### Show Preview V2\n\n![[dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.ref.web-ui#show-preview-v2,1:#*]]\n\n---\n\n## Navigation\n\n### Lookup\n\n- shortcuts:\n  - mac: `cmd+L`\n  - key: `ctrl+l`\n\nInitiate note lookup\n\n![[dendron.topic.lookup]]\n\n### Lookup (Journal Note)\n\n- shortcuts:\n  - key: `ctrl+shift+j`\n  - mac: `cmd+shift+j`\n  - args: `{'noteType': 'journal'}`\n\nInitiate note lookup with journal note pre-selected\n\n### Lookup (Scratch Note)\n\n- shortcuts:\n  - key: `ctrl+shift+s`\n  - mac: `cmd+shift+s`\n  - args: `{'noteType': 'scratch', 'selectionType': 'selection2link'}`\n\nInitiate note lookup with scratch note pre-selected\n\n### Lookup Note\n- shortcuts: none\n\nInitiate a note lookup. This is the successor to the [[Lookup|dendron.topic.commands#lookup]] command, limited to just notes. It is significantly faster on large workspaces when compared to its predecessor and also comes with addiitional [[modifiers|dendron.topic.lookup.modifiers]]. \n\n### Lookup Schema\n\n- shortcuts:\n  - mac: `cmd+shift+L`\n  - key: `ctrl+shift+l`\n\nInitiate schema lookup\n\n### Open Link\n\n- shortcuts: none\n\nOpen link to external file (eg. pdf, .mov, etc) use system default. Relative files paths will be opened relative to the vault that the note is in.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/01250485e20a4cdca2a053dd6047ac68\"><img src=\"https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/01250485e20a4cdca2a053dd6047ac68-with-play.gif\"> </a>\n\n---\n\n## Hierarchies\n\n### Reload Index\n\n- shortcuts: none\n\nReload the index. Necessary for Dendron to pick up on schema changes.\n\n### Archive Hierarchy\n\n- shortcuts: none\n\nMove current note and all children under the `archive` hierarchy\n\nThis is a convenience method around `Refactor Hierarchy` for the case of archiving hierarchies you are no longer using. For example, if you were currently at `pro.foo`, running `Archive Hierarchy` would be equivalent to running `Refactor Hierarchy` with the following arguments:\n\n- matcher: `pro.foo`\n- replacement: `archive.pro.foo`\n\n<a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/9698d5a4451b49d8b107f3ff67d97877\"> <img style=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/9698d5a4451b49d8b107f3ff67d97877-with-play.gif\"> </a>\n\n### Refactor Hierarchy\n\n- shortcuts: none\n\nUpdate hierarchy using regex\n\nLike `Rename Note` but works on an entire hierarchy of notes. This command takes two arguments:\n\n- matcher: regex that matches text you want to capture for replacement\n- replacer: regex that represents text you want to use as replacement\n\nAfter running the command, you will be taken to a preview that shows all files that will be affected. You will be given an option in a dropdown to either proceed with the refactor or cancel the operation.\n\n- NOTE: Dendron will warn you if refactoring will overwrite existing files. You will need to either change your `replacer` or move the affected files before Dendron will perform a refactor\n\nRefactor Hierarchy is a huge time-saver:\n<https://discordapp.com/channels/717965437182410783/743194856788328497/743195382795993291>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/11d90a86fd1348a5a504406b52d79f85\"> <img style=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/11d90a86fd1348a5a504406b52d79f85-with-play.gif\"> </a>\n\n### Goto Note\n- shortcuts:\n  - key: `ctrl+enter`\n  - when: `editorFocus`\n\nGoto to the note under the cursor, creating it if it doesn't exist.\n\n### Go Up\n\n- shortcuts:\n  - mac: `cmd+shift+up`\n  - key: `ctrl+shift+up`\n  - when: `editorFocus`\n\nGo to closet non-stub parent of the currently open note\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/hierarchy.go-up.gif)\n\n### Go Next Sibling\n\n- shortcuts:\n  - key: `ctrl+shift+]`\n  - when: `editorFocus`\n\nGo to the next sibling\n\nSiblings with numeric names will be sorted numerically, whereas siblings with alphabetical names will be sorted alphabetically when determining the next sibling.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/hierarchy.go-sibling.gif)\n\n### Go Previous Sibling\n\n- shortcuts:\n  - key: `ctrl+shift+[`\n  - when: `editorFocus`\n\nGo to the previous sibling\n\nSiblings with numeric names will be sorted numerically, whereas siblings with alphabetical names will be sorted alphabetically when determining the previous sibling.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/hierarchy.go-sibling.gif)\n\n### Go Down\n\n- shortcuts:\n  - mac: `cmd+shift+down`\n  - key: `ctrl+shift+down`\n  - when: `editorFocus`\n\nGo down the hierarchy\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/hierarchy.go-down.gif)\n\n---\n\n## Hooks\n\n### Hook Create\n\nCreate a custom [[hook|dendron.topic.hooks]] to trigger during Dendron's lifecycle.

You can skip this initial indexing if you have a current Dendron workspace running. \n\nIn that case, the CLI can connect to the current engine instead of starting a new one using the following command. \n\n```bash ^Vn7zB1oSBz07\ncd {root/of/workspace}\n# .dendron.port has the port of the current running workspace\nnpx dendron buildSite --wsRoot . --stage dev --serve --enginePort `cat .dendron.port`\n```\n\n### Using a custom port\n\n\n## Pod Commands\n\n- NOTE: you can find pod ids in the [[pods|dendron.topic.pod]] page. Just add a `.import|.export` to the end of the id (eg. `dendron.pod.json.import`)\n\n### Export Pod\n\n- export a pod\n\n- eg: Export notes to JSONPod\n\n```\ndendron exportPod --podId dendron.json --wsRoot . \n```\n\n### Import Pod\n\n- eg: Import notes from FilePod\n\n```\ndendron importPod --podId dendron.markdown --wsRoot . \n```\n\n### Publish Pod\n\n- eg: Publish a note as regular markdown\n\n```bash\ndendron publishPod --wsRoot . --podId dendron.markdown --noteByName dendron\n```\n\n## Vault Commands\n\n```sh\ndendron vault <cmd>\n\nvault related commands\n\nPositionals:\n  cmd  a command to run                  [string] [required] [choices: \"create\"]\n\nOptions:\n  --version         Show version number                                [boolean]\n  --help            Show help                                          [boolean]\n  --wsRoot          location of workspace\n  --vault           name of vault\n  --quiet           don't print output to stdout\n  --enginePort      If set, connect to to running engine.

The biggest factors for choosing Dendron are the hierarchical structure, the multiple vaults, and the many existing VS Code extensions.\n\n> Hierarchies make a lot more sense to my brain. And some of the research I've glanced at suggests it is better for PKM than tags or other free-form structures.\n\n> Having multiple vaults made me comfortable jumping fully into Dendron. I currently have 3 separate vaults: one for my daily life & work as a librarian/journal editor, a second for my dissertation-related things, and a third that my wife & I will soon start syncing on our separate computers. I'll eventually make a fourth for notes I'll publish on my website—but this is the start of the semester, and I have to avoid that kind of exciting but time-intensive project at the moment! I appreciate that references will work between these vaults—but I don't need to worry about accidentally sharing a note with a link to \"project.kitchen-plumbing-disaster\" with my dissertation advisor, or flood my wife's computer with my reading notes and dissertation idea fragments. This fundamental separation lets me feel comfortable using one tool for all these disparate domains.\n\n> Having the full range of existing VS Code extensions for things like Pandoc, BibTeX, or Zotero, plus web development, means that I don't need to hope that someone else involved with Obsidian, Foam, etc will make a plug-in that does what I need for an edge case use. Dendron plugs into a much larger pool of people, many of whose are doing academic and web-related work. I don't do much with data analysis, but I imagine it would be nice to use VS Code tools for Python or R in the same program one uses for academic writing.\n\n- Ryan, Librarian","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/0ddffabc-c78b-4765-a3df-8ffa35dd1391.html","relUrl":"notes/0ddffabc-c78b-4765-a3df-8ffa35dd1391.html"},{"doc":"Myles","title":"Myles","hpath":"dendron.testimonials.myles","content":"\n> I started taking organised notes in 1993.

I was frequently changing my tools without a fixed workflow in the early days of stepping into the productivity and note taking world, it is just great to see that so many cool guys are building tools to make knowledge management a pleasure and more efficient. I met Dendron at the time that I was in a chaos state using different note taking apps like Roam, Obsidian, Evernote, etc and had been sticking with it for a couple months now. I have also tried other tools meanwhile as well but eventually I always turn my head back to Dendron.\n> \n> Dendron is: \n> - [x] open source\n> - [x] build your own workflow\n> - [x] write, store and publish\n> - [x] good community and support \n> - [x] cool guys in the core team\n>  \n> which suits my taste (**a lot**). So to speak, working my notes inside dendron is a pleasure as well. Dislike other note taking apps, in Dendron both hierarchy and linking is provided and you can combine them according to your likings. Referencing to [this article](https://nesslabs.com/how-to-choose-the-right-note-taking-app) from Nesslabs, Dendron fits both **Gardeners** and **Librarians** by combining the power of _hierarchy, linking and publishing_. Garderners can just ignore the hierarchy and do the linking while Librarians can focus on the hierarchy through the naming of the notes with each hierarchy separated by periods `.` . The `C-l` lookup feature is absolutely great too. If you are in between both categories (like me), then Dendron is definitely your first choice for hybrid workflows. \n> \n> Publishing notes is a pleasure as well (finally) by [managed publishing](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/ae4a0c98-e2ea-47e0-8a20-016eba3424be.html) and you can directly publish your notes after hosting them on github (of course you can make it private too I think) instead of rewriting them and publish them as a website. **Everyone can build their second brain or wiki.**\n> \n> I store everything in Dendron now and I know it's secure and they're simply plain text markdown files so no one knows (and cares) if I store anything personal or not. Although Dendron is not perfect (yet) and have some room of improvement, it suits my needs personally and these issues will eventually be solved by cool guys in the team or in the open source community. \n> \n> If you think Dendron is interesting, just give it a try and start building your second brain.\n>  \n> That's all I want to say and I apologize for the profanity in the title if you feel offended.

Hating your note-taking tool does not lead to better productivity, but I kept telling myself there was a PEBCAK and made fewer and fewer notes.\n> \n> Someone suggested I should use Joplin as a more secure alternative to OneNote, and there I went down the rabbit hole of note-taking apps. Keeping notes in Markdown wasn't a new concept to me, but didn't pay much attention to it before trying out Joplin.

The [Dendron Public Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/dendronhq/projects/1).\n\nThe public roadmap is designed to give you more information about what features and functionality you can expect from Dendron over the coming months. With more transparency into what we’re building, you can share feedback earlier and have more influence into what we’re building.\n\n![](/assets/images/2021-05-29-00-38-50.png)\n\n## Context\n\nOur roadmap is intended to align with Dendron's overall [[Mission statement|dendron.mission-statement]]. We have only added the top-level \"epics\" to our roadmap i.e. the large things that will have a lot of impact on the user experience.\n\nThis year, we plan to focus on three things to maximize impact:\n\n1. **Build out Dendron's core functionality**: lookup, schemas, pods, visualization, preview, sharing, plugins, and performance. These are some of the foundational features Dendrologists rely on everyday and we will make sure that they keep getting better. We will continue to add new features, improve existing features, and make sure that the core note-taking functionality is more intuitive and easier to use over time.\n\n2. **Create a Federated Knowledge Repository**. The promise of Dendron is to help people manage knowledge at scale. Most knowledge already exists in READMEs, specs, and other places. We want to make it easy to access both existing content as well as for Dendrologists to share their own.\n\n3. **Build out Dendron for Teams**. Dendron is great to use as an individual but is even more powerful when used with others. To this end, we are building out authentication, synchronization and sharing features to make Dendron a best in class tool for collaboration.\n\nThese goals lead us to the following set of features. These can definitely change (and they're really the highlights amongst all the other enhancements and bug fixes) but hopefully this gives you a birds-eye view of what we're delivering.\n\n### In Q3\n\n-   [Unified Markdown Preview](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/643)\n-   [Standalone Vaults](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/41)\n-   [Schema Improvements](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/712)\n-   [Private published sites](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/758)\n-   [Markdown export pod](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/541)\n\n### In Q4\n\n-   [Advanced Queries](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/159)\n-   [Database storage layer](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/759)\n-   [Better autocomplete](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/663)\n-   [Synchronization Pods](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/732)\n-   [Better Pods](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/701)\n\nWe'll be sure to add more issues here, but go over to the [Github project](https://github.com/orgs/dendronhq/projects/1) if you want the latest info.\n\n## Feedback\n\nIf you have questions or comments, share them either as [Github issues](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/new/choose) or in the `#feedback` channel [in Discord](https://discord.gg/xrKTUStHNZ).\n\nIn addition to the content of the roadmap being updated regularly, we will also iterate on the format of the roadmap itself. We see the potential of reactions, issue comments, and even GitHub Discussions being useful for receiving direct signals back from the community about what we’ve planned. If you have feedback about the roadmap repository itself, such as how the issues are presented, let us know on Discord as well.\n\n## How can you help?\n\nWe're really lucky to have a strong community committed to building open-source knowledge management tools. There are a few ways to get involved:\n\n1. **Bug Bash:** We're always working on performance and stability improvements, please [file actionable bugs](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=) with good details. It'll help us prioritize them and fix them!\n2. **Document and Publish:** We're on a journey to improve documentation in all forms. If you're interested in contributing, please help build out a strong list of preset vaults - [PKM](https://pkm.dendron.so/), [TLDR](https://tldr.dendron.so/), [AWS](https://aws.dendron.so/) or [this wiki](https://wiki.dendron.so/).\n3. **Develop:** A super impactful way to get involved is by working on and delivering one of the community-picked features. We have [a separate section](https://github.com/orgs/dendronhq/projects/1#column-13569288) in the roadmap just for issues that have been highly requested by the community (and feasible to tackle in isolation).\n\nMake sure to check out the [[roles|dendron.community.roles]] to get more ideas for ways to help.\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/6e4c4f61-80a3-46fa-9ad3-04b99d9e9695.html","relUrl":"notes/6e4c4f61-80a3-46fa-9ad3-04b99d9e9695.html"},{"doc":"Project","title":"Project","hpath":"dendron.roadmap.project","content":"This hierarchy describes the short term and long term projects of Dendron.\n\n## Q4 2020\n\n- [[Principles and Values|dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.principles-and-values]]\n- [[Pods|dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.pods]]\n- [[The Seed Bank|dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.seeds]]\n- [[Recruit Gardeners|dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.recruit-gardeners]]\n- [[Quality of Life Improvements|dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.qol]]\n- [[Dendron Language Server Protocol|dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.server-migration]]\n- [[Multi-Vault Support|dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.multi-vault]]\n- [[Community Building|dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.community-building]]\n- [[Power Functionality|dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.power-functionality]]\n- [[Better Docs|dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.better-docs]]\n- [[Git All The People|dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.git]]\n- [[Long Term Sustainability|dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.long-term-sustainability]]\n\n## Commenting and Reviews\n\n### For Dendrologists\n\nThe easiest way to leave a comment is by using the [code stream extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CodeStream.codestream).\n\nYou should have received an invite to be part of the **Dendrologist** team (if not, ping Kevin).  \n\nAfter you install the extension and log in, you'll be able to leave comments inline in the the docs!\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/project.code-stream.gif)\n\n## Other Resources\n\n- [[Cookbook|dendron.roadmap.project.cook]]: Optional things to help you manage Dendron projects\n\n# Structure\n\n## Custom Frontmatter\n\n- start: start date for project\n- end: end date for project\n\n## Snipets\n\n- `project`: creates the outline for a new project\n\n## Sections\n\n```\n## Goals\n\nWhat are we trying to accomplish.

Also, what happens if there's a filename collision across vaults?\n\n## Jojo\n\nmulti-vault support is on the roadmap for this year. for naming collisions, i was thinking the following:\n\n- by default, surface all results with the vault name in the prefix\n\nsay a user has the following vaults\n\n```\n.\n└── workspace\n    ├── kevin-vault\n    │   └── python.hello.md\n    └── jojo-vault\n        └── python.hello.md\n```\n\nuser enters the following lookup: `python.hello`\n\nthey should see the following result\n\n```\npython.hello - kevin vault\npython.hello - jojo vault\n```\n\nwe can also introduce a vault specific prefix (eg. {vault}/{path}) to un-ambiguously specify our result\n\nuser would type `kevin-vault/python.hello` to specify they want to access `kevin-vault`\n\n\"why don't we just show all matches for an unprefixed link\" - this would work inside vscode, but if the user just publishes the workspace with conflicting vaults, I guess the link must point to some single pre-selected place(?). Also, I think the intent behind the link is to point to a single location, so asking user to fix it would probably be reasonable.\nThere's probably all kind of complex scenarios that we could envision (e.g. what if the user would like to merge domains across vaults and show all merged notes in the published page as a merged web page?), but then again 99.9% of the real cases probably just want to use multiple folders and avoid conflicts. Showing errors would probably be the easiest and still sufficient solution.\n\n### Kevin\n\ncoming back to this thread. agree with your conclusion. the other solution would be to generate a popup/intermediary page for links with multiple destinations and let the user choose.\ne\nfor v1, would bias for what you suggested and error at build time. \n\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/012b49e8-7638-4856-afc2-2db3c6406a86.html","relUrl":"notes/012b49e8-7638-4856-afc2-2db3c6406a86.html"},{"doc":"Entries","title":"Entries","hpath":"dendron.roadmap.project.n","content":"\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/167bd57c-fb54-4a71-85b2-c26ba6df29fc.html","relUrl":"notes/167bd57c-fb54-4a71-85b2-c26ba6df29fc.html"},{"doc":"Backlog","title":"Backlog","hpath":"dendron.roadmap.project.n.backlog","content":"\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/529fb02a-3ca9-4fbc-bcba-9435f8d13e89.html","relUrl":"notes/529fb02a-3ca9-4fbc-bcba-9435f8d13e89.html"},{"doc":"Org Mode","title":"Org Mode","hpath":"dendron.roadmap.project.n.backlog.org-mode","content":"## Goals\n\nSupport org-mode sytnax within Dendron\n\n## Details\n\nThis project discusses how to best incorporate org-mode functionality into dendron\n\n## Proposals\n\n1. support {file}.org files\n2. support `org` syntax within `md` files\n\n### 1.

This can be implemented using the React Sortable Tree plugin, which will also be used for creating schemas.\n\n#### Organising the information connected to a node in a semantic and legible manner\n\nA standard graph view spreads the connected nodes arbitratily around the outside of a parent node. This is useful for understanding the general 'shape' of the connections between notes, but in order to understand the immediate connections between any particular note it is easier if they are arranged in a structured and comprehensible fashion. A view that visualises notes in a mindmap style format can achieve this.\n\n#### Activating mindmap view\n\nThe mindmap view can be triggered through the command palette as a Dendron command, as well as from an icon in the Activity Bar, or through the right-click context menu on a note. Launching it from the activity bar or command palette will launch it in the root of your vault, while launching it from the right click context menu on a note will open it focused to that particular note.\n\n#### Indication of related note\n\nWhen a note is opened from the mindmap view (or the mindmap view is opened from a note), it is linked so that navigating to other notes via the mindmap panel will open them in that same panel. This can be indicated by an icon in the menu bar of the linked panel, or an icon in the tab in the linked panel.\n\n#### Creation of new child notes by clicking\n\nA '+' icon on a note when clicked can add a child note underneath that note.\n\n#### Schema visualisation\n\nA mindmap-style visualisation lends itself to visualising the abstract concept of a schema. A note with a schema applied shows the potential nodes that it could have according to the schema as transparent notes with a '+' symbol, which when clicked will create that note.\n\n#### Expanding scope of mindmap focus\n\nThe mindmap view can also be expanded to show additional generations of notes from the same focused note (the grandparents and grandchildren of the focused note). There are '+' and '-' buttons in the mindmap view panel to increase or decrease the amount of visible generations.\n\n#### Configuration options\n\nTBD\n\n## Questions\n\n### What is the difference between this and Dendron's graph view?\n\nThe graph view shows an overview of your _entire knowledge base_ and can be traversed by scrolling and zooming. This can be useful for understand the general structure of all your notes, and the broad relationships between domains in your hierarchy but is less suited for focusing on a particular domain.\n\nThe mindmap view would allow users to focus their attention on a particular node, it's siblings, parents and children, view them in a visually organised manner, and traverse their notes by selecting notes directly attached to that domain. In this sense, it is more suited to giving you an overview of a particular _domain_.\n\n## Resources\n\n- [The Brain App](https://www.thebrain.com/)\n- [Discussion](https://discordapp.com/channels/717965437182410783/739186036495876126/766252142549270550)\n- [React Sortable Tree](https://github.com/mikcaweb/react-sortable-tree)\n\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/533857a4-3dcb-478e-9877-5ab7f94ed6e6.html","relUrl":"notes/533857a4-3dcb-478e-9877-5ab7f94ed6e6.html"},{"doc":"Related","title":"Related","hpath":"dendron.roadmap.project.n.backlog.color-tabs","content":"- [github issue](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/261)\n\n## Goals\n\nSupport custom colorization of tabs in Dendron, specified by schema. \n\n## Details\n\nVSCode has the following settings for tabs. \n\n```\n\"workbench.colorCustomizations\": {\n    \"tab.activeBackground\": \"#FFFFFF\",\n    \"tab.activeForeground\":\"#000000\",\n    \"tab.inactiveForeground\":\"#FFFFFF\",\n    \"tab.inactiveBackground\":\"#000000\",\n    \"tab.border\":\"#FFFFFF\"\n}\n```\n\nThe properties that can be customized are `activeBackground` and `inactiveBackground`.

Note that the migration will involve standing up **two servers**: one for language server functionality (the lsp server), and another for dendron's [lookup](https://dendron.so/notes/a7c3a810-28c8-4b47-96a6-8156b1524af3.html) capabilities (the express server). \n\nThe rationale for having two servers is discussed [here](https://discordapp.com/channels/717965437182410783/748936364283920495/759153642644701285).\n\nThey are also elaborated upon [here](https://discordapp.com/channels/717965437182410783/735365126227493004/765435624878505985)\n\nInstead of calling the engine directly, the Dendron extension, as well as related plugins, will communicate to Dendron's server using IPC and on local ports. \n\n## Tasks\n\n- [x] add LSP server to Dendron (0.12)\n- [x] add api server to Dendron (0.12)\n- [x] hook server into dendron startup (0.12.4)\n- [x] migrate lookup to server model \n  - [x] support query notes (0.12.6)\n  - [x] support query notes with schema (0.12.6)\n  - [x] support write notes (0.12.6)\n  - [x] support write note with schema (0.12.6)\n  - [x] support delete note (0.12.7)\n  - [x] support query schema (0.12.7)\n  - [x] support write schema (0.12.7)\n  - [x] support delete schema  (0.12.7)\n- [x] optimize server lookup performance (0.12.7)\n- [x] enable file watcher (0.12.7)\n- [x] dendron tree view (0.12.7)\n- [x] migrate commands\n  - [x] scratch note (0.12.7)\n  - [x] journal note (0.12.7)\n  - [x] copy note command (0.12.7)\n  - [x] copy note url (0.12.7)\n  - [x] lookup scratch note (0.12.7)\n  - [x] lookup journal note (0.12.7)\n  - [x] global journal note (0.12.7)\n  - [x] build pod (0.12.8)\n  - [x] rename note\n  - [x] archive hierarchy\n  - [x] refactor hiearchy\n  - [x] doctor\n- [x] integration tests for all server functionality\n\n## Next\n\n- migrate bundled extensions to server model\n- use custom goto definition provider \n- use custom backlink definition provider\n- use schema based completions\n\n## Configuration\n\nTo enable server mode, update the following setting in your workspace settings `\"dendron.useExperimentalLSPSupport\": true`.

While both characteristics matter, we agree to make these tradeoffs when necessary.\n\n-   function over form\n    -   in dendron, its more important for something to be useful than it is to be beautiful\n    -   the focus in dendron should be about your content and the hierarchies that connect them\n-   focus on speed\n    -   we can't predict the future but its likely that no one will ever say that they wish their note taking experience to be slower\n    -   when thinking about features and tool chain, bias for speed\n-   focus on hierarchies\n    -   while dendron supports backlinks and other forms of organizing notes, dendron's foundation is tooling to help you manage hierarchies\n-   retrieval over insertion\n    -   Knowledge only compounds if it's easy to refer back to and connect messages weeks, months or even years after it's written. We value structure that provides enough context for your notes to be valuable for the long haul.\n\n## Related\n\n-   [[dendron.principles]]\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/35d7d7bc-64a6-4850-9a54-7de7f43ad751.html","relUrl":"notes/35d7d7bc-64a6-4850-9a54-7de7f43ad751.html"},{"doc":"Power functionality v0","title":"Power functionality v0","hpath":"dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.power-functionality","content":"## Goals\n\nSupport power user functionality \n\n## Details\n\nTBD\n\n## Tasks\n\n- schemas\n  - [ ] [specify sections within notes](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/248)\n\n## Next\n\nTBD\n\n## Links\n\n- [project docs](https://dendron.so/notes/ff1b9ea5-6d0e-49b2-97d1-a7e31299164e.html)\n- [issues](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/labels/pro.power-func-v0)\n\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/ff1b9ea5-6d0e-49b2-97d1-a7e31299164e.html","relUrl":"notes/ff1b9ea5-6d0e-49b2-97d1-a7e31299164e.html"},{"doc":"Pods v0","title":"Pods v0","hpath":"dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.pods","content":"## Goal\n\nMake it possible for people to import/export their data between Dendron and **any other** platform that contains information a user might care about.\t\n\n## Details\n\nDendron wants to be your **central digital nervous system** - our end goal is to be the **best possible way** to create, build, use, and share the knowledge that matters to you. \t\nTo do that effectively, we believe its important that you have **full control of your information**. This means having your data available in plaintext markdown and having an note-taking tool that is local and open source. But we want to go further than that which is where [pods](TODO) come in. \t\nDendron refers to a pod as anything you could conceivably use to store/publish notes. Evernote, Roam, static websites, twitter - any and all of these things are potential pods. The vision with pods is that you should be able to seamlessly move **your information** in and out a pod and in and out of Dendron. \t\n\nUnlike what the [notion](https://www.notion.so/) marketing folks might tell you, we don't believe there is a one size fits all approach when it comes to knowledge management, a concept that includes collecting articles, project management, journaling, collaboration, and basically any workflows that involve working with information.\t\n\nWhile Dendron will make it possible for you to do these things, it will also help you move your information to tools that do it better for a given use case. Imagine being able to collaborate on a note using [google docs](https://docs.google.com/), use the spreadsheet functionality in [airtable](https://airtable.com/) to organize and all the while keep a canonical copy of that note inside Dendron where it is just a lookup away. \t\n\nIf you have ideas about pods and pod related workflows that you would like to see us build, please come discuss them with us in our newly created [#pods](https://discord.gg/8vjasHj) channel. \t\n\n## Tasks\n\n- [x] establish basic pod framework\n- [x] use pods via extension\n- [x] use pods via CLI\n- [x] create 2 pods\n- [ ] support custom pods\n- [ ] document pods\n\n## Next\n\n- community voting on pods\n- stabilize pod API\n\n## Links\n\n- [project docs](https://dendron.so/notes/b1dbd32d-ca87-4489-9ba0-01bf7928cba5.html)\n- [issues](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/labels/pro.pods-v0)\n\n## Related\n\n- [[dendron.topic.pod]]\n- [[pod proposal issue|dendron.roadmap.project.scratch.2020.09.07-164009]]\t\n\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/b1dbd32d-ca87-4489-9ba0-01bf7928cba5.html","relUrl":"notes/b1dbd32d-ca87-4489-9ba0-01bf7928cba5.html"},{"doc":"Multi Vault Support","title":"Multi Vault Support","hpath":"dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.multi-vault","content":"## Goals\n\nUsers should be able to create multiple vaults for a given workspace. Each vault is a folder that can contain any number of hierarchies. \n\n## Use Cases\n\n- for **sensitive notes**, multi-vault enables local only vaults vs vaults that can are synced on file sharing services like dropbox \n- for **modularizing knowledge**, multi-vault enables users to mix and match existing vaults depending on context\n- for **federating and curating knowledge**, multi-vault enables users to publish/subscribe to public vaults using protocols like `git`\n- for **access control**, multi-vault lets users configure specific vaults to be **private** which turns off publication and sharing of any notes inside said vault\n\n## Concepts\n\n![[dendron.ref.workspace#summary,1:#*]]\n![[dendron.topic.vaults#summary,1:#*]]\n![[dendron.concepts#hierarchies:#*]]\n![[dendron.concepts#domain:#*]]\n\n## Specs\n\n- a workspace can have one or more vaults\n- a workspace can have one or more workspace configs\n- vaults have a path relative to the workspace and an optional name\n  <!-- - the initial vault is called `main` -->\n  <!-- - vaults can be referred to by name using the `$` prefix  -->\n\n## Flow\n\n### Initialization\n\nTo facilitate separation and re-usability of vaults, we are changing how the initial workspace is laid out in Dendron.\n\nToday, all files (configuration, vaults, docs) are located directly inside the **workspace root**.\n\n![[dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.multi-vault#file-layout-for-legacy-workspace,1:#*]]\n\nWith multivault, workspace configuration  will be moved underneath a separate folder underneath the **configuration root**. By default, this will inside a folder named **config**.\n\n![[dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.multi-vault#file-layout-for-multi-vault-workspace,1:#*]]\n\nInside a multi-vault workspace, each vault and config will be initialized as separate and independent git repositories. To initialize a multi-vault workspace, you can run `Dendorn: Initialize MultiVault Workspace` to bootstrap the folder layout that you see above. \n\nWe will also be releasing a migration script that can convert a single vault workspace into a multi-vault workspace. \n\n### Configuration\n\nThe `dendron.yml` file will be modified to have additional metadata for vaults that have remote repositories associated with them. A remote root is not required unless you plan on cloning your workspace to other computers. \n\n```yml\nvaults:\n  - fsPath: vault1\n    remote:\n      type: git\n      url: /path/to/vault1/repo\n  - fsPath: vault2\n    remote:\n      type: git\n      url: /path/to/vault2/repo\n      branch: nightly # optional, target specific branch\n```\n\n### Cloning\n\nCloning is the act of checking out a workspace on another machine. To clone, Dendron will have the `Dendron: Clone Workspace` command. It will take the url of a remote **workspace configuration** repo as input as well as a local path for the **workspace root**. Cloning will checkout the _workspace configuration_ underneath the _workspace root_ and also checkout all the vaults that are associated with the configuration underneath the workspace.\n\n### Add a new Vault\n\n- run `Dendron: Add Vault`\n  - specify file path relative to the current **workspace root**\n  - specify an optional user friendly name for the vault\n    - if no name is set, the last component of the file path will be used\n- when the user hits enter, the vault is created as an \"empty vault\"\n  - empty vaults will contain a `root.md` and `root.schema.yml` file\n\n### Lookup\n![[dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.multi-vault#file-layout-for-multi-vault-workspace,1:#*]]\n\n- lookup: {empty query}\n  - show all top level results of all vaults. note how the vault name shows up in parenthesis next to the result\n  - results\n    ```\n    root (vault1)\n    root (vault2)\n    foo (vault1)\n    foo (vault2)\n    ```\n- lookup: `vault1/`\n  - by prefixing lookup with the vault name, you can narrow results to a particular vault\n  - results\n    ```\n    root (vault1)\n    foo (vault1)\n    ```\n- lookup: `foo.`\n  - dendron will merge all results from all vaults when you do a lookup\n  - results\n    ```\n    foo.one (vault2)\n    foo.two (vault1)\n    ```\n- lookup: `foo.new`\n  - when you lookup a note that doesn't exist, you'll have the option of creating the note in either vault\n  - results\n    ```\n    Create New (vault2)\n    Create New (vault1)\n    ```\n\n### Navigating Links\n![[dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.multi-vault#file-layout-for-multi-vault-workspace,1:#*]]\n\n- navigating  to `[[foo]]` will result in a display prompting the user to select the vault to navigate to \n  - the UI should be similar to the **Peek Action**\n    ![](/assets/images/2020-10-19-20-48-52.png)\n\n- navigating to `[[foo.two]]` will directly navigate to the note since it is unique across all vaults\n\n- navigating to `[[vault1/foo]]` will open foo in vault1 \n\n### Moving Notes Between Vaults\n\n- TBD\n\n### Publishing Notes\n\n![[dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.multi-vault#file-layout-for-multi-vault-workspace,1:#*]]\n\n- configuration to publish everything under foo\n  -

It is also a process for reviewing and discussing the\nproposal and tracking its implementation. \"Request for Comments\" means a request\nfor discussion and oversight about the future of Dendron from contributors and\nusers. It is an open forum for suggestions, questions, and feedback.\n\nThe process is intended to be as lightweight and reasonable as possible for the\npresent circumstances. As usual, we are trying to let the process be driven by\nconsensus and community norms, not impose more structure than necessary.\n\nThe RFC process itself is subject to changes as dictated by the core team and\nthe community. Proposals can include proposed changes to the RFC process itself\nto better serve contributors.\n\n## When to submit an RFC?\n\nYou should consider using this process if you intend to make \"substantial\"\nchanges to [Dendron](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron) or related tools.\nSome examples that would benefit from an RFC are:\n\n-   Major new features where the desired exprience is ambiguous.\n-   Any change to existing APIs that could break existing code.\n-   The removal of existing features or public APIs.\n-   Changes to the documented contribution workflow.\n-   Features that cross multiple construct libraries.\n-   Additions or changes to framework capabilities.\n\nThe RFC process is a great opportunity to get more eyeballs on your proposal\nbefore it becomes a part of a released version of Dendron. Quite often, even\nproposals that seem \"obvious\" can be significantly improved once a wider group\nof interested people have a chance to weigh in.\n\nThe RFC process can also be helpful to encourage discussions about a proposed\nfeature as it is being designed, and incorporate important constraints into the\ndesign while it's easier to change, before the design has been fully\nimplemented.\n\nIf you submit a pull request to implement a new major feature without going\nthrough the RFC process, it may be closed with a polite request to submit an RFC\nfirst.\n\nSome changes do not require an RFC:\n\n-   Bugfixes for known issues.\n-   Additions only likely to be _noticed by_ other developers of Dendron, invisible\n    to end product users.\n\nIf you're not sure whether your change requires an RFC, feel free to create an\nissue and ask.\n\n## RFC Process\n\nIn short, to get a major feature added to Dendron, one usually writes an RFC as\na markdown file and gets it approved and mergd into the Dendron-site. At that\npoint the RFC is 'in review' and may be implemented.\n\n1. [Create a **tracking issue**](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=work-item.md&title=)\n   for the proposed feature if one doesn't already exist. If a tracking issue\n   already exists, make sure to update it and assign it to let others know\n   you're working on a proposal. tracking issue number and `<my-feature>` is the\n   rfc title.\n2. Fill in an RFC under the rfc.\\* hierarchy on dendron-site.  Use the [[Rfc template|templates.rfc]] when creating a RFC. We recommend that you add this repository to your workspace by following the instructions [[here|dendron.topic.seed-bank.quickstart#adding-a-seed-to-an-existing-workspace]].\n3. Submit a **pull request** with the title `RFC: ### <title>` where ### is the\n   tracking issue number and title is the name of the proposal. As a pull\n   request the RFC will receive design feedback from the core team and the\n   larger community, and the author should be prepared to make revisions in\n   response.\n4. Update the tracking issue with a link to the RFC PR.\n5. **Promote** your RFC amongst stakeholders via Discord. Build consensus and integrate feedback. RFCs that have broad support are much more likely to make progress than those that don't receive any comments. ^Y6KpVpRVS0S9\n6. Eventually, the team will decide whether the RFC is a candidate for inclusion\n   in a future release of Dendron.\n7. RFCs that are candidates for inclusion will enter a \"**final comment\n   period**\" lasting 3 calendar days. The beginning of this period will be\n   signaled by a team member adding a comment and label on the RFCs pull\n   request.\n8. An RFC can be modified based upon feedback from the team and community.\n   Significant modifications may trigger a new final comment period. An RFC can\n   also be modified after it has been merged and approved, in which case a new\n   PR will be submitted with the modification, like any other code.\n9. An RFC may be **rejected** by the team after public discussion has settled\n   and comments have been made summarizing the rationale for rejection. A member\n   of the team will then close the PR and issue.\n10. An RFC may be **accepted** at the close of its final comment period. A team\n    member will merge the RFCs associated pull request, at which point the RFC\n    will become 'approved'.\n11. At some point, someone will pick up the RFC for implementation. For major\n    features this usually requires devising a detailed implementation plan. To\n    that end, submit an **additional PR** on the RFC doc that either fills in\n    the \"Implementation Plan\" section or references a separate document or\n    GitHub Project Board which includes the plan.\n12. Once this PR is approved, the RFC will move to the 'implementing' state.\n    Usually we track implementation using GitHub projects.\n13. Once implementation is complete, the RFC moves to 'done', and it's issue is\n    closed.\n\n> If the submitter is someone from our community (i.e., not core team member), a\n> core team member will be assigned to 'shepherd' each proposal. They will\n> generally be the ones updating the RFCs state in the tracking issue as it\n> moves through the process. They can decide when a final comment period is\n> triggered.\n\n## RFC States\n\n1. **💡 proposed** - A tracking issue has been created with a basic outline of the proposal.\n1. **✍️ review** - An RFC document has been written with a detailed design and a PR is under review. At this point the PR will be assigned a **shepherd** from the core team.\n<!-- 3. **⏰ final comments** - The shepherd has approved the RFC PR, and announces\n   that the RFC enters a period for final comments before it will be approved\n   (~1wk). At this stage, if major issues are raised, the RFC may return to\n   **Review**. -->\n4. **👍 approved** - The RFC PR is approved and merged to `master`, and the RFC\n   is now ready to be implemented.\n5. **🗺️ planning** - A PR is created with the **Implementation Plan** section of\n   the RFC.\n6. **👷 implementing** - Implemetation plan is approved and merged and the RFC\n   is actively being implemented.\n7. **1️⃣ phase one done** - Implementation for phase 1/2/3 is complete. These phases will be determined in the RFC and a single RFC can have at maximum 3 phases.\n8. **✅ done** - Implementation is complete and merged across appropriate\n   repositories.\n9. **👎 rejected** - During the review period, the RFC may be rejected and then\n   it will be marked as such.\n1. **👩‍🌾 community issue** - This RFC is accepted but is not currently part of our roadmap. We will leave this as a community project for gardeners that are interested in taking this on. \n\n---\n\nDendron's RFC process\n[looks up](https://handbook.dendron.so/notes/b89ba854-72fb-4ebc-a8a0-55960b89e9dc.html#lookup)\nto [AWS CDK RFC process], [Yarn RFC process], [Rust RFC process], [React RFC\nprocess], and [Ember RFC process]\n\n[aws cdk rfc process]: https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk-rfcs\n[yarn rfc process]: https://github.com/yarnpkg/rfcs\n[rust rfc process]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs\n[react rfc process]: https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs\n[ember rfc process]: https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/f143ca38-dcc6-4cd3-b84b-997aec1160ef.html","relUrl":"notes/f143ca38-dcc6-4cd3-b84b-997aec1160ef.html"},{"doc":"9 Note Lifecycle Hooks","title":"9 Note Lifecycle Hooks","hpath":"dendron.rfc.9-note-lifecycle-hooks","content":"\n## Goals\n\nCreate plugin system that can execute custom logic when notes are being changed.\n\n## Context\n\nWe currently have limited ways of programmatically updating a note while editing in Dendron.

Plugins should have the following format\n    ```js\n    /**\n     @params note: Object with following properties https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/common-all/src/types/typesv2.ts\n     @params execa: instance of https://github.com/sindresorhus/execa#execacommandcommand-options\n     */\n    module.exports = async function({note, execa}) {\n        // do some changes\n        return note;\n    };\n    ```\n\n## Details\n\nAt startup, Dendron will register all plugins found in the `plugins` section of `dendron.yml`. At runtime, when Dendron creates/updates/changes a note, it will call the corresponding plugins in the order they were registered via the yml.\n\nDendron currently supports a node minimum runtime of v12 which means javascript plugins that target this environment should be supported. \n\nWe also have an escape hatch for non-javascript executables using [execa](#execacommandcommand-options) to execute an existing binary. Note that you'll have to pass in the note object yourself to the given binary. \n\nYou can see the example of a note object [[here|pkg.dendron-engine.ref.note-response]]\n\n## Example\n\n- dendron.yml\n```yml\nplugins:\n    onCreate:\n        - id: addEmoji\n        # only add to journals matching daily.*\n        pattern: \"daily.*\"\n        type: js\n    onDelete: ...\n    onChange: ...\n```\n- plugins/addEmoji.js\n```js\nmodule.exports = async function({note}) {\n    note.body += 🌱\n    return note;\n};\n```\n\n## Tradeoffs\n- adding plugins to the note lifecycle can add extra latency to function calls\n- shelling out using `execa` is ugly and really a placeholder until we get url endpoints working\n\n## Future work\n- being able to register arbitrary url endpoints as extensions\n\n## Discussion\n- Submit feedback in our [github discussion](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/discussions/680)\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/d2f8fe67-36c7-4600-b745-c22bdcb5b2cf.html","relUrl":"notes/d2f8fe67-36c7-4600-b745-c22bdcb5b2cf.html"},{"doc":"8 Multi Publish","title":"8 Multi Publish","hpath":"dendron.rfc.8-multi-publish","content":"\n## Goals\n\nPublish multiple sites using one workspace\n\n### Sub Goals\n\nMake it possible to share links of multiple published sites from one workspace.\n\n## Context\n\nCurrently, to publish a new site, users have to create a new workspace, even if its to publish using the exact same vaults. \n\nSimilarly, if a user wants to reference urls from multiple published sites, they would need to keep multiple workspaces open. \n\n## Proposal\n\nIntroduce a `sites` parameter that is made from multiple [[site objects|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.topic.publishing.configuration#global-configuration]].\n\nWhen a user uses [[Copy Note URL|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.topic.commands#copy-note-url]], Dendron can output one of the following:\n- if the note is part of **one** published site (as determined by `siteHierarchies` and `duplicateNoteBehavior`), we return the url\n- if the note is part of **multiple** published sites, we return a dropdown asking the user to pick a url\n- if the note is part of **zero** published sites, we return an error message \n\n## Details\n\n### Calculating a published site\n\nThis can be bothersome since we need to keep track of all hiearchies that are published and determine if they are unique to a single vault. \n\nFor phase one, we will default to returning a dropdown of all valid urls and having the user choose. \n\n## Example\n\n```yml\nsites:\n    - \n    name: handbook\n    copyAssets: true\n    siteHierarchies:\n        - handbook\n    siteRootDir: docs\n    usePrettyRefs: true\n    siteUrl: 'https://handbook.dendron.so'\n    title: Dendron Handbook\n    duplicateNoteBehavior:\n        action: useVault\n        payload:\n            - handbook\n    - \n    name: wiki\n    copyAssets: true\n    siteHierarchies:\n        - dendron\n    siteRootDir: docs\n    usePrettyRefs: true\n    siteUrl: 'https://wiki.dendron.so'\n    title: Dendron Wiki\n    duplicateNoteBehavior:\n        action: useVault\n        payload:\n            - dendron-site\n```\n\n## Tradeoffs\n\nWe're introducing more complexity in the configuration for an easier publishing experience. \n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/8b3bfb16-8330-4a78-85cc-45581c319450.html","relUrl":"notes/8b3bfb16-8330-4a78-85cc-45581c319450.html"},{"doc":"7 Graph Rework","title":"7 Graph Rework","hpath":"dendron.rfc.7-graph-rework","content":"\n## Description\n\nThis RFC contains Multiple Proposals on how to improve the Graph handling of Dendron.\n\n## Goals\n\n-   Functional improvements of the Graph\n    -   View\n    -   Filtering\n    -   Coloring\n    -   Embedding\n-   Performance Improvements\n-   Connection between Graph's\n    -   Multi-Vault\n    -   Other published Gardens and their Graph's see [[RFC 5|dendron.rfc.5-publishing-registry]]\n-   Clarify what is part of the Graph.\n\n## Questions\n\n-   What does the Graph represent?\n-   [[Hierarchies and the Graph|dendron.rfc.7-graph-rework.hierarchy]]bet\n-   [[How are Notes represented in the Graph|dendron.rfc.7-graph-rework.notes]]\n-   [[What role do Schemas play in the Graph|dendron.rfc.7-graph-rework.schemas]]\n\n## Tenets\n\n-   Ownership of the Graph\n-   Functionality\n-   Performance\n-   Entry point to a Decentralized Graph\n-   Connectivity\n\n## Use Cases\n\n-   Graph View improvements\n-   Connection of Graphs\n-   Verification of Graphs against Schemas\n\n## Proposal\n\n1.

Schemas","title":"Graph Rework - Schemas","hpath":"dendron.rfc.7-graph-rework.schemas","content":"## Goal\n\nClarify what role schemas play in the Graph.\n\n## Description\n\nCurrently, Schemas and the Notes are separated entities with two different structures.\nIn my eyes, a schema should be a Property of a Hierarchy Level.\n\nAs an example, we have the Schema **\"Journal\"**:\n\n```yml\nversion: 1\n\nschemas:\n- id: journal\n  title: Journal\n  parent: root\n  children:\n    - daily    \n- id: daily\n  title: Daily\n  children: \n    - year\n- id: year\n  title: \"Year:${pattern}\"\n  pattern: \"20[0-9][0-9]\"\n  children:\n    - month\n- id: month\n  title: \"Month:${pattern}\"\n  pattern: \"[0-1][0-9]\"\n  children:\n    - day\n- id: day\n  title: \"Day:${pattern}\"\n  pattern: \"[0-3][0-9]\"\n  namespace: true\n```\n\nThis Schema would validate a particular Hierarchy pattern lets take the example from the [[Graph Rework - Hierarchy|dendron.rfc.7-graph-rework.hierarchy]] file to explain it.\n\nWe have the Hierarchy `journal.daily.2020.04.10` that would turn through this Schema into the following structure:\n\n```yml\nJournal:\n  schema: journal\n  children:\n    - daily\nDaily:\n  schema: daily\n  children: \n    - \"2020\"\n\"2020\":\n  schema: year\n  value: 2020\n  children: \n    - \"04\"\n\"04\":\n  schema: month\n  value: 04\n  children: \n    - \"10\"\n\"10\":\n  schema: day\n  value: 04\n  children: []\n```\n\nWhich Schould turn into the following Graph:\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TB\n    Journal-->|child|Daily \n    Daily-->|child|2020   \n    2020[Year:2020] -->|child|04\n    04[Month:04]-->|child|10\n    10[Day:10]    \n```\n\n## Further Thoughts\n\nThe Schemas should provide a way to use the Value that gets matched from the Pattern it gives, like in this case done for the title.\n\nFurther extensions of this could be to provide multiple patterns.\nAn example here could be the Month schema, to have a group of Schemas that act as one Hierarchy level Month but have different patterns and styles.\n\n```yml\nschemas: \n  - id: month\n    title: \"$element.title\"\n    type: group\n    elements: \n       - January\n       - February\n       - \"...\"\n       - \"December\"\n  - id: january\n    title: \"January\"\n    patterns: \n       - \"january\"\n       - \"January\"\n       - \"01\"\n\n```\n\nEach month gets declared like January is in that Schema.\nHaving that possibility would be extending the possible use cases of Schemas in my Eyes.\n\n## Author\n\nflammehawk:\n\n- [@Github](https://github.com/flammehawk)\n- @Discord fudo#1010","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/a155f412-d730-48cc-8893-1bcb7f637206.html","relUrl":"notes/a155f412-d730-48cc-8893-1bcb7f637206.html"},{"doc":"Plan","title":"Plan","hpath":"dendron.rfc.7-graph-rework.plan","content":"\n## Goals\n\n![[dendron.rfc.7-graph-rework.design#Summary:#Lookup]]\n\n### Core Functionality\n\n-   Functional improvements of the Graph\n    -

If you're looking for the GraphViz export pod, [[you can find its documentation here. | dendron.topic.pod.builtin.graphviz]]\n\n## Summary\n\n<!-- High level overview of solution -->\n\nThe goal of this graph redesign is to create a better-performing, filterable graph view useable by both a published Next.js site and within VSCode.\n\n## Lookup\n\n<!-- Research and similar projects -->\n\n-   [Obsidian's Graph View](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Graph+view)\n-   [Foam's Graph View](https://github.com/foambubble/markdown-links)\n    -   Also forked from `markdown-links`, so maybe not super useful\n\n## Proposal\n\n### Libraries\n\nIn the interest of balancing development speed and flexibility, the current recommendation is to use [Cytoscape.js](https://js.cytoscape.org/) for rendering and graph structuring. This is for a couple of reasons:\n\n-   Fully-featured network/graph structuring and rendering\n-   Robust graph manipulation and filtering\n-   Functions as both rendering and graph structuring library\n-   Straightforward documentation\n-   Battle-tested: used in production by both companies and researchers\n-   Future-proof: option to run in headless mode\n    -   Option to use custom rendering logic if needed while still maintaining graph structure and filtering already implemented\n\nHere is the [[list of all libraries researched.|dendron.rfc.7-graph-rework.library-research]]\n\n### Implementation\n\n#### Graph Structure\n\nOne of the benefits of going with a Next.js-centered approach is we get all the benefits of React and global state. Since notes will be loaded into the global Redux store already, querying them and creating the graph structure should be fairly straightforward.\n\n#### Styling\n\nStyling in Cytoscape is done through a style object, which is a CSS-like style array. There are two clear options for styling: either a dedicated CSS stylesheet or a config file with various options. Since the Cytoscape styling method is slightly abstracted from direct CSS, it may be easier to use a config file and lightly parse it into a useable form.\n\n#### Performance\n\nOne of the biggest issues with visualization libraries is performance. While adding many nodes and edges to a graph can degrad`e performance, Cytoscape contains [a number of optimization options](https://js.cytoscape.org/#performance/optimisations) to scale large, complex graphs.\n\nPerformance is determined primarily by the layout algorithm used. The current implementation will use the [cytoscape.js-euler](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape.js-euler) layout, as it is able to display a graph with thousands of nodes and edges in an understandable format.\n\n#### Accessibility\n\n##### Keyboard Navigation\n\nBasic keyboard navigation will be implemented for the new graph view. This will include navigating up and down between hierarchies, cycling between child nodes, and opening notes.

Navigating through the eco-system Ant Design newcomer can be overwhelming to decide what the best way to plan your app is.\n\nFor example you have here the [core React Library](https://ant.design/docs/react/introduce).\n\n-   But when reading their [theming docs](https://ant.design/docs/react/customize-theme), the first references to sub libraries are already creating the need to make some important decisions.\n\nie Either create all of your theme using the default.\n\n### Theming\n\nAnt Design gives 4 options to [customize-theme](https://ant.design/docs/react/customize-theme) .\n\n1. [Customize-in-webpack](https://ant.design/docs/react/customize-theme#Customize-in-webpack)\n2. [Customize-in-Umi](https://ant.design/docs/react/customize-theme#Customize-in-Umi)\n3. [Customize-in-create-react-app](https://ant.design/docs/react/customize-theme#Customize-in-create-react-app)\n4. [Customize-in-less-file](https://ant.design/docs/react/customize-theme#Customize-in-less-file)\n\n#### Customize-in-webpack\n\nThis could actually be the best option as loading directly into webpack is said in the docs to have potential performance improvements.\nhttps://medium.com/@GeoffMiller/how-to-customize-ant-design-with-react-webpack-the-missing-guide-c6430f2db10f\n\nAnd considering that Next.js uses Webpack 5 & [allows for a custom-webpack-config](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/custom-webpack-config)\n\n#### Customize-in-Umi\n\nThis only seems to be an option if you are using Ant Design Pro, which is their out of the box solution including Routing etc.\n\n#### Customize-in-create-react-app\n\nNot an option as Dendron uses Next.js across the board.\n\n#### Customize-in-less-file\n\nAlso a viable option, but IMO less attractive than loading directly into webpack because\nA) Need to use css less syntax which is not well known among developers today.\nB) Can't use JavaScript Objects for theming which is quite convenient.\nC) Potentially less performant\n\n## `dendron-design-system` Usage\n\n1. Add all theme files with [design tokens](https://spectrum.adobe.com/page/design-tokens/) to `dendron-design-system`.\n2. Allow package to be consumeable, either on `npm` or within the Dendron monorepo.\n3. In each dendron Next.js application, import the theme from `dendron-design-system`.\n4. Load The theme into webpack via `next.config.js`\n\nExample:\nPsuedocode (not yet tested)\n\n```javascript\n// https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/next-mdx\n\nimport {theme} from 'dendron-design-system'\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  webpack: (config, options) => {\n    config.module.rules.push(rules: [{\n    test: /\\.less$/,\n    use: [{\n      loader: 'style-loader',\n    }, {\n      loader: 'css-loader', // translates CSS into CommonJS\n    }, {\n      loader: 'less-loader', // compiles Less to CSS\n+     options: {\n+       lessOptions: { // If you are using less-loader@5 please spread the lessOptions to options directly\n+         modifyVars: theme,\n+         javascriptEnabled: true,\n+       },\n+     },\n    }])\n\n    return config\n  },\n}\n```\n\n## Example\n\nCurrently W/ Chakra-UI, update to Ant-Design upcoming.\n\nhttps://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/tree/master/packages/dendron-design-system\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/1bb018db-8f8e-46c8-ac4a-4baf4813b0c8.html","relUrl":"notes/1bb018db-8f8e-46c8-ac4a-4baf4813b0c8.html"},{"doc":"6 Dendron Design System","title":"6 Dendron Design System","hpath":"dendron.rfc.6-dendron-design-system","content":"\n\n## Goals\n\nIn order to keep a consistent UI across Dendron apps:\nCreate a design-system of UI components and theme objects, hosted on npm that can be installed and used across all Dendron applications.\n\n## Use Cases\n- When building out a new React based Dendron project, instead of needing to create a components folder and create all your own local components per project, you can instead install ie. `yarn add dendron-design-system` and start building the app using these components like lego blocks.\n\n- Creating a consistent UI across apps.

Export Pod - export Dendron notes into their Notion workspace.\n2. Import Pod - import pages/database from notion workspace to dendron vault\n\n## Proposal\n\nThe [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) export pod that can transfer contents of a dendron vault to a Notion workspace. The export config having additional options to export a specific vault.\n\n\n## Details\n\nUsing Notion Export Pod can be a two step process\n1. Authentication\n1. Choosing the parent page\n\n### Authentication\n\nThe Notion API uses tokens/api-key to authorize requests from integrations.\n\nStep 1: Create an integration: \n1. Go to [My-Integrations](https://www.notion.com/my-integrations).\n1. Click the \"+ New integration\" button.\n1. Give your integration a name - I chose \"Novels\".\n1. Select the workspace where you want to install this integration.\n1. Click \"Submit\" to create the integration.\n1. Copy the \"Internal Integration Token\" on the next page and save it to the dendron notion export pod config file.\n\nStep 2: Share a database with your integration\nIntegrations don't have access to any pages (or databases) in the workspace at first. A user must share specific pages with an integration in order for those pages to be accessed using the API.\nStart from a new or existing page in your workspace. Click on the Share button and use the selector to find your integration by its name, then click Invite.\n\n### Choosing the parent page\n\nThe exported notes cannot be attached at a workspace level and require a parent page.\nThe Pod will automatically query for pages on your Notion workspace and provide you with a drop down list of pages for you to choose as a Parent. The most recently created page will appear at the top of the dropdown.\n\n## Example\n\nHere is an example [video](https://www.loom.com/share/3e2972062d6a46639a34d4d60e0e4a54) for an initial draft of Notion export pod.\n\n## Tradeoffs\n\n1. The Notion API has a rate limit of 3 requests per second. If the dendron vault contains a large number of notes, it might take several minutes to export, quite similar to when we manually import notes in Notion, it first uploads all the notes and them import.\n\n1. Exporting Dendron Notes to Notion requires a change in the format of notes. The Markdown needs to be parsed into Notion Blocks for Notion to comprehend it and parse accordingly.\n\n## Discussion\n\nhttps://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/discussions/1364\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/duBTaQ58NeFFsSDF4yoSs.html","relUrl":"notes/duBTaQ58NeFFsSDF4yoSs.html"},{"doc":"3 Standalone Vaults","title":"3 Standalone Vaults","hpath":"dendron.rfc.3-standalone-vaults","content":"\n## Goals\n\nMake it possibel to use Dendron outside of a workspace using standalone vaults.\n\n## Details\n\nCurrently Dendron requires a `dendron.code-workspace` file and to be in an active VSCode Workspace to work. This is cumbersome for a few reasons:\n\n-   it requires that a user be in an active vscode workspace\n-   it doesn't let you use Dendron in an existing VSCode project (eg. editing `docs` folder inside a code workspace)\n\nSee this [issue](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/402) for more details.\n\n## Proposal\n\nStandalone Vaults will make it possible for Dendron to work outside of a workspace.\n\nVaults will be initialized with their own config file like the one below\n\n```\n- vault/\n    - dendron.vault.yml\n```\n\nThis file will be similar to [[dendron.yml|dendron.topic.config.dendron]] but with vault specific properties which are listed below\n\n-   notes: string\n    -   specify where to look for notes\n    -   by default, this will be `.` which stands for all files in this directory\n    -   you can add multiple rules and standard globbing rules will apply\n-   vault:\n    -   this is similar to the [[vault property |dendron.topic.config.dendron#vault-properties]] of `dendron.yml`\n    -   when a standalone vault is included in a dendron workspace, the vault properties in `dendron.vault.yml` will be merged and take precedence\n    -   no `fsPath` property\n\n```\n- docs/\n    - dendron.vault.yml\n    - README.md\n    - notes/\n    - assets/\n```\n\n## Related\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/ceca23ee-6181-4fa6-9724-9943433c6e96.html","relUrl":"notes/ceca23ee-6181-4fa6-9724-9943433c6e96.html"},{"doc":"29 Contextual UI","title":"29 Contextual UI","hpath":"dendron.rfc.29-contextual-ui","content":"\n## Goals\n\nImprove UI and feature discoverability for Dendron commands and workflows.\n\n## Context\n\nAlmost all of of Dendron's user-initiated behaviors are performed through the command pallette via `Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`. While this is a very efficient UI and a first-class paradigm in VS Code, there are a lot of areas where being able to initiate commands without the command pallette can be fast and more familiar to users. Let's call this contextual UI, as most of these interaction points occur at the place where a user is trying to perform an interaction (i.e. within the editor, or within a pane).\n\nThere are a few benefits to this:\n- improve discoverability of features\n- reduce learning curve of adopting Dendron by adopting UI paradigms that are familiar to general users and developers in VS Code\n- overall efficiency gains while using Dendron\n\nThis will also hopefully solve some user pain points around stale cache problems and reduce (and eventually eliminiate) the need for explicitly running the `Reload Index` command, which is not user-friendly.\n\n## Proposal\n\nTo add additional contextual UI as entry points to commonly used Dendron commands. Some of the proposals below may not be possible with the current VS Code API - some more investigation into the feasibility of some of the proposals may be required.\n\n_**Note**: This spec is evolving. We will likely continue to add additional items as we think of better ways to optimize the UI and as the VS Code API expands._\n\nThere are a few main places where we can add contextual UI\n- Context Menus (Right Click on something such as a folder or file, or within the editor)\n- [Code Actions](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#CodeActionProvider)\n\n\n## Details\n\n### Panes\n_UI on the (typically) left hand side panel of VS Code_\n\n#### Explorer Pane\n\n##### Add/Remove Vault\n\nProposed UI: `Add Vault` and `Remove Vault` options in explorer pane by the context menu - Right Click > [Add|Remove] Vault.\n\nIntuitively, people are used to modifying their folders via explorer. Right now, if someone removes a vault via explorer by removing folder, this will only update the code-workspace file and not update `dendron.yml`. This should also cover seeds behavior, although it's important to note that we're in the process of converging seed behavior with vault behavior.\n\nAlso see Lookup Section below for Standalone Vaults and how that may affect this feature.\n\n##### Delete Note\n\nProposed UI: Right click on a note in explorer > delete.\n\nThis UI option already exists - however, if a user does this instead of using the `Delete Node` command, then the engine/cache may not properly update.\n\nTODO: Seems like this already works? Can anyone verify engine and cache are properly updated on manual note deletion?\n\n##### Create Note\n\nProposed UI: Right clicking > New File. Our engine should automatically be aware of the new note.\n\n##### Rename Note\n\nProposed UI: Right click on existing Note > Rename File.\n\nEngine automatically picks up this behavior. VS Code also has a feature for languages where it will prompt if you want to rename references as well. Can we achieve that same functionality here? Can we also make this a part of the built in vs-code `rename` context menu option? Requires a little more investigation as to how this works.\n\n#### Tree View\n\n- Rename Title by Right Clicking on an element\n\n### Editor\n\n#### Rename Header via F2\n\nProposed UI: Rename Note with `F2` semantics - in the same way we can rename a variable in code by clicking on the variable name and then hitting `F2`, then typing a new variable name, and all references are updated automatically - let's do the same with a header within a note.\n\nDeveloper Notes for this feature:\n- https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/programmatic-language-features#rename-symbols\n- https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/refactoring\n\n#### Code Errors and Warnings\n\nIdeas TBD - but in what additional ways can we take advantage of code errors and warnings? See [this VS Code API Feature](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/programmatic-language-features#possible-actions-on-errors-or-warnings)\n\nSome ideas:\n- Broken Links or References - can we incorporate executing a doctor command from the code warning context menu, potentially as a [QuickFix Code Action](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#CodeActionKind)\n- TBD\n\nSome ways we are already doing this:\n- Invalid Frontmatter\n\n#### Refactor Extract\n\nWe can extract highlighted text using refactor extract to move it to a new note (TBD, API should be explored more in depth). This could be similar to the current functionality of creating a new note in 'Selection Extract' mode.\n\nSee [Refactor Extract](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#CodeActionKind)\n\n## Tradeoffs\n\nPotentially by adding more UI, we introduce more complexity to the interaction model of Dendron. Some of these entry points may be a bit harder to test reliably in automation.\n\n## Discussion\n<!-- Click the link and create new discussion -->\nhttps://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/discussions/1336","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/VellOqHuzrUyzrWc0ajvg.html","relUrl":"notes/VellOqHuzrUyzrWc0ajvg.html"},{"doc":"28 Notifications","title":"28 Notifications","hpath":"dendron.rfc.28-notifications","content":"\n## Goals\n\nAllow users of shared vaults to send notifications to each other through Dendron.\n\n## Context\n\nIn vaults shared by many users, it can be useful to get the attention of a user.\nFor example, one user may want to let another user know that a note they are\nwriting is ready for them to look at. Or in a shared journal, a user who needs\nhelp can notify another user to ask for help.\n\nWhile these communications could be done over other channels, such as messaging\napps or texts, these channels usually send notifications that alert users and\ndemand immediate attention. In some cases, it may be preferable to simply leave\na notification for the other user to look at without alerting them immediately.\n\nAdditionally, in some settings, keeping a trail of these notifications within\nthe notes may be preferable. Keeping these notifications public within a\nknowledge base allows others to review them, and the resulting communication is\nstored within the knowledge base as future reference.\n\n## Proposal\n\nAdding a special user notification syntax to Dendron would allow users to send\nnotifications through Dendron.\n\nA user can type `[ ]@username` to send a notification to that user. The user,\nonce notified, can type `x` between the brackets to confirm receipt of the\nnotification.\n\nTransferring these notifications are simply done through regular sync channels.\nSyncing a workspace sends out any notifications that were added, and receives\nnotifications added by other users.\n\n## Details\n\n### User names\n\nTo find the username of the current user, Dendron can read the OS username of\nthe user. Dendron will also allow the user to set the username globally with a\nglobal file (for example, `~/.dendron-user`) or a per-workspace file (for\nexample, `Dendron/.dendron-user`).\n\n### Notifications overview\n\nIf the user has many notifications, Dendron can show a UI that lists all the\nnotifications they received. The same page can also be brought up using a\ncommand, or integrated into the side bar.\n\n### Implementation\n\nNotifications are propagated through the existing sync mechanism, no additional\nwork is needed. Finding the notifications is relatively cheap: it can be done\nwhen searching for new links in updated notes during a sync. Notifications can\nbe displayed using VSCode notifications.\n\nThe overview UI can be implemented with a web-based UI.\n\n## Example\n\n- `Edsger` writes in their notes: `... I'm stuck on this issue, can [ ]@Frances take a look at this?`\n- `Edsger` syncs their workspace.\n- `Frances` syncs their workspace.\n- `Frances` automatically receives a notification: `Someone mentioned you: \"...

Important benefit is that it allows non tech people to contribute/see test cases that are happening. The big big downside of Vanilla BDD is its overhead, its not at all cheap to do BDD. And this isn't a suggestion that we start doing BDD.\n\nNow when it comes to regular testing typical unit test names tend to fall short in describing the scenarios in question. Even if developer tries to write out a descriptive name of the test the length of the screen often falls too short to actually give the **context** of the test in a single name. Plus its quite an overhead if we try to add context into each test name. So that's where BDD Light style comes in to add additional clarity to test structure. \n\n## Proposal\n\nBDD Light attempts to organize tests in such a way that we get the benefit from BDD verbage showing clearly what we are testing (and what we are potentially missing) while keeping the agility of regular tests. \n\nIn short to use BDD-Light we start off by using BDD verbs: GIVEN, WHEN, THEN, AND\n* GIVEN: Where setup action goes.\n* WHEN: When something happens such as calling something.\n* THEN: Thats when our expected cases go.\n* AND: Allows to stack additional conditions. \n\nNext step is to add the setup correlated with each block into a [beforeEach](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/engine-test-utils/src/__tests__/engine-server/util/lruCache.spec.ts#L4-L9) if the tests are readonly and the setup takes a long time (such as some integration tests) than consider using beforeAll (However, for unit tests always start out with beforeEach). This way we don't duplicate the setup between the tests and everything within the describe block will get the appropriate context.\n\nIf there is a single THEN (assert) for a WHEN scenario then we can combine the WHEN and THEN into a single statement as in [example](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/engine-test-utils/src/__tests__/engine-server/util/lruCache.spec.ts#L68-L70). If there are multiple THEN assertions for a WHEN scenario then have the WHEN be a describe and multiple THENs nested under it as in [example](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/engine-test-utils/src/__tests__/engine-server/util/lruCache.spec.ts#L11-L16). If we have an extra condition/branch under an existing WHEN then use and AND as in [example](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/engine-test-utils/src/__tests__/engine-server/util/lruCache.spec.ts#L24-L27). \n\n## Example\n\nHere is an example of using BDD-Light setup [lruCache.spec.ts](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/engine-test-utils/src/__tests__/engine-server/util/lruCache.spec.ts) \n\nWhich produces the output:\n\n```\n PASS  packages/engine-test-utils/src/__tests__/engine-server/util/lruCache.spec.ts (13.51s)\n  lruCache.spec.ts\n    GIVEN lruCache configured for 5 elements\n      WHEN added 5 elements\n        ✓ THEN all 5 elements are present in the cache (3ms)\n        AND added 6th element\n          ✓ THEN last 5 elements are present in the cache (1ms)\n          ✓ THEN first element added is NOT in the cache\n        AND asked for element #1\n          AND added 6th element\n            ✓ THEN element #1 is IN the cache (1ms)\n            ✓ THEN element #2 is NOT in the cache\n            ✓ THEN elements 3-6 are in the cache (1ms)\n```\n\nThe test cases that are being tested can be seen from the output. \n\n## Tradeoffs\n### PROs\n* Makes the output of tests readable (to understand what is happening from output).\n    * Quite often looking at the clearly defined output makes one see another test case to add to particular branch.\n        * And since the setup is re-used adding such test is cheap.\n* Makes the failures much more clear since context is given from test naming.\n* Allows for writing one assert per test, without it being a headache.\n* Avoids duplicating setup.  \n* Compliments 'jest' well. Since jest doesn't allow messages in their 'expect' asserts having descriptive focused test names fills this gap. \n\n\n### CONs\n* Takes a little bit of time to get used to, since its a bit cludgy to add things into beforeEach especially for 'WHEN' action cases. But after a little bit of time it becomes pretty natural. \n* If beforeEach used with slow initialization tests can run slower since setup is triggered per test.\n* If beforeAll is not used carefully, can cause confusing test failures due to tests modifying shared state (same CON with any common initialization though).\n\n## Discussion\n[Github discussion thread](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/1309)","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/m7iWYQRtPIYsIEd3zVPqg.html","relUrl":"notes/m7iWYQRtPIYsIEd3zVPqg.html"},{"doc":"24 Custom Theming","title":"24 Custom Theming","hpath":"dendron.rfc.24-custom-theming","content":"\n## Goals\n\nProvide custom theming for Dendron Preview[^1] and the Dendron NextJS Template [^2]\n\n## Context\n\nDendron currently does not allow for custom theming of either the preview or the published site. This is one of our highest request features in regards to preview and publishing. \n\n## Proposal\n1. Introduce new command, `Customize Theme`, which will do the following:\n    - this command has two options: `preview` and `publishing`\n    - if the user selects `preview`, create a file called `style.less` at `{workspace}/style.less`\n    - if the user selects `publishing`, create a file called `style.less` at `{workspace}/.next/style.less`\n1. Introduce new command, `Apply Theme`, which will do the following:\n    - this command has two options: `preview` and `publishing`\n    - on `preview`, when Dendron runs in a workspace with a `style.less` file, it will style Dendron using the given stylesheet\n    - on `publishing`, when Dendron publishes notes in a next project with a `style.less` file, it will publish using the given stylesheet\n\n## Out of Scope\n- customizing mermaid theme\n- customizing prismjs theme\n- having light and dark versions of themes\n\n## Implementation\n\n### Less to CSS Conversion\nWe need to transform less to css before we can consume it in React. Currently we use the following gulp script [^3] to make this happen with the default theme.\n\nFor custom theme, we'll need to run the gulp script when `Apply Theme` has been called.  Instead of generating the css in `public`, the css should be generated in `{workspace}/build/style.css` if generating for `preview` and in `{workspace}/.next/public/style.css` for `publishing`\n\n- NOTE: we can't directly generate the stylesheet in the Dendron extension directory because VSCode checks the checksum of the extension dir after installation\n\n### Fetching CSS \n\n#### Preview\nPreview theme logic is described here [^preview-theme]. A new theme needs to be added to the themeMap called `custom`.  \n\nThe theme path needs will be a request to the  `getTheme` [^api-theme] method which will need to be adjusted to accomadate the preview theme.\n\n#### Publishing\nPreview theme logic is described here [^publish-theme].  A new theme needs to be added to the themeMap called `custom`. \n\nThe theme path can be set to `/style.css` since the css can be directly put into the `public/` folder.\n\n### Setting the new theme\n\n#### Preview\nWhen loading the nextjs template, add a new query parameter that will indicate to Dendron that we are using a custom theme. See the dendron-next architecture [^next-server-arch] to see how this is done today. Modify the `_app.tsx` to recognize this parameter and apply the custom theme. \n\n#### Publishing\nAdd an environmental variable in [`.env`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables) to indicate we are using a custom theme. Modify the `_app.tsx` to recognize this parameter and apply the custom theme. \n\n\n#### Preview\nTBD\n\n## Example\n\n### Adding a new theme to the preview\n1. User run command: `Dendron: Customize Theme`\n1. User Select:  `preview`\n1. Dendron Creates `{workspace}/style.less` and open the editor to given page\n1. User makes edits\n1. User run command: `Dendron: Apply Theme` \n1. User Select:  `preview`\n1. Dendron compiles `{workspace}/style.less` to `{workspace}/build/style.css`\n1. User run command: `Dendron: Show Preview`\n1. Dendron shows preview with new theme\n\n### Deleting a theme\n1. User deletes `{workspace}/style.less`\n1. User run command: `Dendron: Apply Theme` \n\n## Tradeoffs\n- Pros\n    - Keeps compatibility with existing [AntD](https://ant.design/) design framework\n- Cons\n    - Adding `gulp` to the plugin along with less -> css processing files will increase the extension size\n    - `less` is no longer mainstream `scss` is much more popular\n\n## Related\n- Working on Dendron Next Server [^next-server-dev]\n- Working on Dendron Next Template [^next-template-dev]\n\n## FAQ\n\n### What is the behavior for mermaid and prism when using a custom theme?\n\nBy default, we will switch to the default light theme of these respective components.

Top level consists of only the groupings. It should not have single configurations.\n1. Top level is grouped by _areas certain features affect_.\n    - rationale:\n      1. Top level group should divide settings as roughly as possible in order to keep the top level namespace simple\n      1. [[This also makes it easily navigatable|dendron.rfc.23-config-consolidation#^sULM0sgtghNt]]\n      - Alternative to this is grouping _features that affect certain areas_.\n        - This makes the top level grouping very crowded and hard to navigate\n        - Some features do not affect multiple groups, leaving a lot of singles on the top level.\n1. Each configuration key should affect one behavior ^D9T8BEFdId1t\n    - rationale:\n      1. Decoupling of configuration\n      1. Clear cut expectation\n1. If a setting affects multiple top level groups, they should be in each group rather than that setting being an object and having multiple keys to different groups.\n    - rationale:\n      1. We are grouping by _areas certain features affect_.\n      1. Turning _certain features_ into an object and giving them the _areas_ as key is going against the initial grouping decision.\n      1. This also forces us to pull out features that affect more than one area out of their namespaces, separating them from the group, adding complexity to the organization of the configuration.\n    - example:\n      - prefer:\n      ```json\n        publishing: {\n          ...\n          mermaid: true\n          ...\n        }\n\n        workspace: {\n          ...\n          mermaid: true\n          ...\n        }\n      ```\n      - avoid:\n      ```json\n          mermaid: {\n            publishing: true,\n            workspace: true,\n          }\n      ```\n1. Allow duplicates as long as they are in different groups. prefer this over pulling keys out of their namespaces and giving them the ability to affect multiple behavior\n    - rationale:\n      1. [[Each configuration key should affect one behavior|dendron.rfc.23-config-consolidation#^D9T8BEFdId1t]]\n      1. Duplication is better than confusion\n      1. [[If we want to offer the ability to affect multiple behavior, this should be done agnostic to how the configuration is structured|dendron.rfc.23-config-consolidation#^qoJ9AQAmc7It]]\n    - example:\n      - prefer\n      ```json\n        publishing: {\n          mermaid: true\n        }\n\n        workspace: {\n          mermaid: true\n        }\n      ```\n      - avoid\n      ```json\n        // enable mermaid diagram rendering for both workspace and publishing\n        mermaid: true\n      ```\n\n### Presentation\n1. Selecting the top level group exposes all possible settings under this group ^sULM0sgtghNt\n    - Individual configurations should be reachable with the smallest clicks possible\n    - Also promotes avoiding implementation of features that does too much.\n1. If there are duplicates in different groups, this should properly signalled to the user\n    - by documentation, or\n    - by way of presenting them a clearly visible message that this behavior is also configurable in another area.\n    - If a config that affects behavior in all possible groups is necessary, this should be done in a way that is agnostic to how the namespace is structure ^qoJ9AQAmc7It\n      - e.g.) as a convenience feature that is exposed to the end user\n1. The configuration UI is a place where a user both _edits_ and _views_ configurations.\n    - It is important that the experience is smooth for both scenarios\n    - editing:\n      - Possible choices for configuration needs to be apparent at the time of editing\n      - Editing a configuration that can affect multiple areas should be intuitive\n        - Idea: Filtering of configurations\n          - e.g. Typing `mermaid` in the search bar displays `config.publishing.mermaid` and `config.workspace.mermaid`\n    - viewing:\n      - When a user uses the configuration UI with the intent to view a certain group, every key in that group should be presented so that they could be identifiable at a glance.\n        - Even if the groups are deeply nested, the UI should present them in a flat manner unless it generates clutter\n          - Configurations should not be structured to be _too deep_ in the first place in order to avoid this situation, and also promote a simpler/leaner implementation.\n1. The configuration should be presented in a way that is easily understandable.\n    - Configuration keys are defined to be a string without any spaces. The naming is selected to be as clear as possible, but some could use a bit more descriptive labeling.\n    - While the documentation should be sufficient when it comes to fully explaining what every configuration does, it would be better if the way we present the configurations can give a good enough explanation to what it does.\n    - While keeping it backwards compatible, we can add descriptions and labels that are plain English sentences to enable this in the configuration UI.\n    - With the introduction of JSON schema validation, we can also present configurations in a more descriptive way. (i.e. Have the validator display descriptions.)\n\n### Cleanup\n\n#### 1. Define configurable behaviors in the most common package.\n- Type / enum definitions of configurable behaviors should be defined where the configuration is defined, which is `common-all`\n- This is to reduce duplicate type / enum definitions at the place it is actually used (e.g. plugin-core).\n\n##### example\n- `LookupSelectionType` should be defined in `common-all` and imported to `plugin-core`.\n- As is, this is defined in both `common-all` and `plugin-core` as a duplicate.\n\nprefer:\n```js\n  // in common-all\n  export enum LookupSelectionTypeEnum {\n    \"selectionExtract\" = \"selectionExtract\",\n    \"selection2link\" = \"selection2link\",\n    \"none\" = \"none\"\n  }\n```\n\n```js\n  // in plugin-core\n  import { LookupSelectionTypeEnum } from \"@dendronhq/common-all\"\n\n  // this is equivalent to \"selectionExtract\" | \"selection2link\" | \"none\"\n  type LookupSelectionType = keyof typeof LookupSelectionTypeEnum\n```\n\navoid:\n```js\n  // in common-all\n  enum LookupSelectionTypeEnum {\n    \"selectionExtract\" = \"SelectionExtract\",\n    \"selection2link\" = \"selection2link\",\n    \"none\" = \"none\"\n  } \n```\n\n```js\n  // in plugin-core\n\n  // duplicate definitions\n  export type LookupSelectionType =\n    \"selection2link\" | \"selectionExtract\" | \"none\";\n\n  export enum LookupSelectionTypeEnum {\n    \"selection2link\" = \"selection2link\",\n    \"selectionExtract\" = \"selectionExtract\",\n    \"none\" = \"none\"\n  }\n\n```\n\n#### 2. Constant-initializing string literals for enums\n- Prefer initializing enums of possible choices to constant-initialized string literals over letting it implicitly initialize to a numeric enum and auto-increment.\n- They will be used in `dendron.yml` and other places where users can pass it in as an argument (e.g. keybindings.json).\n- Passing in `someConfig: \"someChoice\"` is more intuitive than `someConfig: 0`\n\n##### Example\n\nprefer:\n```js\n  export enum someModeForAMagicCommand {\n    foo = \"foo\",\n    bar = \"bar\",\n    baz = \"baz\",\n  }\n```\n\n```json\n  // in keybindings.json\n  {\n    \"command\": \"dendron.magicCommand\",\n    \"key\": \"cmd+m\",\n    \"args\": {\n      \"someModeForAMagicCommand\": \"foo\"\n    }\n  }\n```\n\navoid:\n```js\n  export enum someModeForAMagicCommand {\n    foo, // this will initialize to 0 and autoincrement\n    bar,\n    baz,\n  }\n```\n\n```json\n  // in keybindings.json\n  {\n    \"command\": \"dendron.magicCommand\",\n    \"key\": \"cmd+m\",\n    \"args\": {\n      \"someModeForAMagicCommand\": 0\n    }\n  }\n```","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/5mfPAJFfNFrD16RbGOs9h.html","relUrl":"notes/5mfPAJFfNFrD16RbGOs9h.html"},{"doc":"22 Queries","title":"22 Queries","hpath":"dendron.rfc.22-queries","content":"\nQueries allow you to explore your knowledge base and answer questions efficiently.\n\n## Goals\n\n- An easy-to-use query language should allow users to query their knowledge base.

For example, all RFCs that are tagged with `#todo` and are connected to a project:\n```\n?[[ or (to tags.todo)\n       (children dendron.rfc)\n       (connected (children projects))\n]]\n```\n\nFind all notes that are tagged with any tag:\n```\n?[[ to (descendants tags) ]]\n```\n\n## Tradeoffs\n\nPros:\n- Using a custom query language allows us to tailor it to Dendron. Users can write compact, efficient queries, and we can provide more immediate feedback.\n- Lisp-like syntax is similar to Roam queries, and will be familiar to lisp users.\n\nCons:\n- Building a custom query language requires more work, compared to something like allowing users to write queries in javascript.\n- Lisp-like syntax may be confusing for users who are not familiar with lisp languages.\n\n## Notes\n\nThe implementation will be internally based on\n[DataScript](https://github.com/tonsky/datascript), which will allow us to\nsupport very powerful queries while also simplifying the implementation.\n\n## Discussion\n\nPlease send any suggestions, thoughts, questions or concerns to the [Discussions](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/discussions/1284) page.","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/O4f9yfDoO7E7gRRDeBeCh.html","relUrl":"notes/O4f9yfDoO7E7gRRDeBeCh.html"},{"doc":"21 - Modern Web Client","title":"21 - Modern Web Client","hpath":"dendron.rfc.21-modern-web-client","content":"\n## Goals\n\nProvide a modern web client for published Dendron notes. \n\n## Context\n\nDendron publishing has gone through a bunch of iteration. We started using a forked jekyll template. When that became too slow for large workspaces (+1k notes), we converted that template to 11ty which improved the build time by over 100x. Half a year and over a hundred features later, we are hitting limits again with 11ty. These limits come from the following: \n\n- lack of modern web tooling: 11ty does not make use of React and other modern web tooling that would make it easier to build and integrate advanced functionality\n- lack of customization: 11ty is tightly integrated with Dendron and makes customizing beyond the Dendron pre-sets hard\n- hard to develop for: the pool of users that are familiar with 11ty, Dendron, and the integration between the two is tiny whereas the pool of web developers familiar with React and NextJS is many orders of magnitude greater\n- scaling issues: 11ty starts to slow down when publishing +10k notes\n- poor local preview support: due to how 11ty + Dendron is integrated, we need to re-compile when you change the workspace\n- lack of typescript support: 11ty is a javascript project and many of the patterns don't lend themselves well to being typed\n- lack of re-use: we've adoped React and NextJS in other parts of our code base but we are not able to re-use the logic in 11ty depsite most of the functionality being the same\n\n## Proposal\n\n- [[1. Replace 11ty with NextJS.|dendron.rfc.21-modern-web-client#1-replace-11ty-with-nextjs]]\n- [[2. Release Dendron's Web Frontend as a vanilla NextJS Template|dendron.rfc.21-modern-web-client#2-release-dendrons-web-frontend-as-a-vanilla-nextjs-template]]\n- [[3. Support live local preview for publishing|dendron.rfc.21-modern-web-client#3-support-live-local-preview-for-publishing]]\n- [[4. First Class Web Experience|dendron.rfc.21-modern-web-client#4-first-class-web-experience]]\n\n### 1. Replace 11ty with NextJS. \n\nThis will make it significantly easier for us to ship new features and maintain our existing feature set. We can re-use the code behind Dendron's [[web ui|dendron.ref.web-ui]] and have a common code base for Dendron across multiple clients. NextJS comes with excellent typescript support and their focus on performance and developer UX are aligned with our own goals as well. \n\n### 2. Release Dendron's Web Frontend as a vanilla NextJS Template \n\nWe had issues trying to integrate 11ty by forcing an integration between it and Dendron. This resulted in large code packages and fragile interfaces that had many edge cases. \n\nBased on these learnings, we decided to release our next generation web frontend as a regular NextJS project. Users can clone the repository and use the standard `next dev` command to get started. We will include custom views and logic so that NextJS can compile your Dendron notes, but otherwise, any experience you have with web development, React, or NextJS can be applied to add additional customizations to the template. \n\n### 3. Support live local preview for publishing\n\nWe currently have poor support for local preview which involves re-compiling all your published notes to see the latest changes. \n\nNextJS supports fetching data on demand and dynamically while in development mode and will allow our users to the published output the moment they are made. \n\n### 4. First Class Web Experience\n\nWe want to make the web experience of using Dendron as great as using Dendron natively in VSCode. Initially, its going to be making sure we have a first class read-only experience. In time, we will also add additional functionality, like the ability to view the note graph, toggle schemas and even edit a note from within the web client\n\n\n## Details\n\n### Performance\n\nBelow are some benchmarks that show the performance comparing 11ty and NextJS when creating a static page with different number of notes. Note that while NextJS has a higher overhead to compile notes in small workspaces, it scales up much better than 11ty as the workspace grows. \n\n| num Notes | 11ty    | nextjs        |\n| --------- | ------- | ------------- |\n| 1e1       | 0.32    | 9.8           |\n| 1e2       | 0.96    | 17.99s        |\n| 1e3       | 9.21    | 18.25         |\n| 5e3       | 75.38   | 24.31         |\n| 1e4       | 223.10s | 35.39         |\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Does this affect being able to host Dendron as a static site?\n\nNope. In the future, we might explore adding dynamic server side features to a published Dendron page but there will always be an option to export everything statically. \n\n### How does this affect SEO?\n\nDendron will still publish all pages as static HTML by default so there should be no change to SEO when compared to 11ty.\n\n### Will there be breaking changes during the migration process?\n\nWe are aiming to keep compatibility with the current configuration options and feature set that is offered in the existing 11ty. We'll post updates if this changes but in general, we don't foresee any breaking changes during development. \n\n## Discussion\n- [21 - Modern Web Frontend · Discussion #1145 · dendronhq/dendron](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/discussions/1145)\n\n## Related\n- [Modern Web Frontend · Issue #1146 · dendronhq/dendron](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/1146)\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/nB75cmdPhL7CTOATG6wpT.html","relUrl":"notes/nB75cmdPhL7CTOATG6wpT.html"},{"doc":"20 - Integrated Space Repetition","title":"20 - Integrated Space Repetition","hpath":"dendron.rfc.20-integrated-space-repetition","content":"\n## Goals\n- create an **integrated space repetition** with basic features (basic/cloze cards) in dendron\n\n## Context\n- **Space Reptition (SR)** is a learning method that encourages one to separate knowledge into different types of cards and memorize effectively through daily practise.\n## Why? \n- Among the large mass of notes, there must be some you want to memorize over the long term. \n- It is not ideal to rely on external extensions for SR. \n- attract more users from the academia\n  - [incremental reading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_reading)\n  - [HQ&A System](https://words.jamoe.org/highlight-question-and-answer/)\n## Proposal\n### Phase I  \n- From my observation (see the section below for additional info), the most ideal choice to implement space reptition features in dendron in my opnion is through an overall structure similar to [Recall](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=frenya.vscode-recall):\n  - cards by `::` \n  - cloze by `{{}}` \n  - open a new window for review \n\n### Phase II \n- Furthermore, the addition of **reviewing cards in published websites** using dendron opens more possibilities because **one can share his cards easily through the site**. \n- and despite basic front-back and cloze cards, features like [image occlusion](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1374772155) can be considered once the basic features are mature. \n\n\n## Details\n### SR Implementation in other apps\n#### RemNote \n- seperate front and back side with `::`\n- cloze by `{{}}`\n\n#### Logseq \n- workflowy-like bullets, parent and children block to separate front and back \n- cloze by `{{cloze }}` \n\n#### VSC Extensions \n##### [Recall](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=frenya.vscode-recall)\n- cards by `::`\n- cannot do cloze \n- card review in vsc \n\n##### [Anki for VSC](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jasew.anki)\n- cards by `##` as front, word under the header as back \n- cloze by `{{c1::cloze}}` followed by the header \n- sync with anki \n\n#### Other Solutions \n- [Andy Matuschak - My implementation of a personal mnemonic system](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4mAF1uBV96r72e4NjLcDaujEyTPGiUQJEj8C?stackedNotes=z5ARNXtS5VxteskEW91S1yYTgAcLABNXsZuJE)\n- [Obsidian to Anki](https://github.com/Pseudonium/Obsidian_to_Anki)\n- [Anki markdown notes](https://github.com/Pradhyo/anki-markdown-notes)\n\n## Example\n- create basic cards through `front::back` and cloze cards through `This is an {{apple}}` syntax \n- review cards in another tab (similar to Recall VSC)\n- \n\n## Tradeoffs\n- this feature is not completely related with the improvements regarding dendron's hierarchy system\n- relatively new feature sets for developers, more research needed\n\n## Discussion\n- discussions are held on [RFC 20 Discussion Board](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/discussions/1133)\n\n\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/X2Zn2H89eBZrsj7Of8LLm.html","relUrl":"notes/X2Zn2H89eBZrsj7Of8LLm.html"},{"doc":"2 Managed Publishing","title":"2 Managed Publishing","hpath":"dendron.rfc.2-managed-publishing","content":"\n## Goal\n\nMake it easy for everyone to publish a [digital garden](https://www.kevinslin.com/)\n\n## Tenants\n- publishing should be accessible to everyone\n\n## Product\n\nProvide a [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) like service focused solely on Dendron based content.\n\nThis service will let you selectively publish your notes using Dendron itself without having to configure a third party host like netlify or github pages.\nPages will be hosted and published using [AWS](aws.amazon.com/) and will be [deployed globally](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/features/) across the AWS edge network. \n\nYour published page will have its own subdomain under `{username}.dendron.wiki`.

The way it works is that the Dendron client will contain a Sentry error watcher; upon hitting an exception, data around that exception will get uploaded to a Sentry hosted secure database. We can then use Sentry's tooling to analyze our user crashes and errors.\n\n## Details\n\nThe types of errors we plan on capturing data for are exceptions and some non-exception induced errors.\n\n### Privacy\n\nWe take user privacy very seriously at Dendron and will not use the collected error data for any purposes other than driving bug fixes in the Dendron product.

Indexes","hpath":"dendron.rfc.18-add-note-indexes","content":"\n## Goals\n\nSupport adding index sections to notes. \n\n## Context\n\nA common use case is to have an index section that lists all the contents of a particular area of the text. In Dendron, we already show you all [[children|dendron.topic.publishing.navigation#children]] of the current note when publishing but this is not available in the editor.\n\n## Proposal\n\nImplement the command, `Dendron: Add Index`, that adds autogenerated index column at the bottom of the given note. \n\n## Details\n\nThe autogenerated index block will look like the below.\n\n```markdown\n<!-- Autogenerated Index Start -->\n## Index\n- [[proj.one]]\n- ...\n<!-- Autogenerated Index End -->\n```\n\nWhen run for the first time, it will generate a child of all the immediate children of the current note. After it has run, Dendron will add `indexLastUpdated` attribute with the timestamp of the last added note. On subsequent runs, `Add Index` will only add children that have been created after the `indexLastUpdated` timestamp. \n\n### Special Cases\n- the `Autogenerated Index` markers are deleted\n  - if we can't find both the `Start` and `End` marker, Dendron will regenerate it at the very bottom of the page\n  - when regenerating, if the note has an `indexLastUpdated` property, we will add all new children that have been created since that time, otherwise, we will generate all indexes\n- the `# Index` header is deleted\n  - same behavior as above\n- a manual line has been entered inside the index block\n  ```markdown\n  ...\n  - [[proj.three]]\n  Some manual line\n  <!-- Autogenerated Index end-->\n  ```\n  - in this case, we would add any new links below the last found link\n  ```markdown\n  ...\n  - [[proj.three]]\n  - [[proj.four]]\n  Some manual line\n  <!-- Autogenerated Index end-->\n  ```\n- user modifies a link after it has been pasted\n  - this is fine, Dendron doesn't process any links it already inserted in a previous run\n\n## Example\n\n### Simple Case\nTake the following hiearchy \n\n```\n- proj.md\n    - proj.one.md\n    - proj.two.md\n    - proj.three.md\n```\n\n- running `Dendron: Add Index` inside proj when blank\n    - adds all entries one level below to the bottom of the note under `## Index`\n    - creates `indexLastUpdated` entry in the frontmatter that has the most recent `created` time \n```md\n---\nid: ...\ntitle: Projects\nindexLastUpdated: 12345 \n---\n\n<!-- Autogenerated Index Start -->\n## Index\n- [[proj.one]]\n- [[proj.two]]\n- [[proj.three]]\n<!-- Autogenerated Index End -->\n```\n\n### Run `Add Index` when entries already exist\n\n- running `Dendron: Add Index` inside proj when there are already entries\n    - dendron will check if there are new direct children since the last `indexLastUpdated` time and add them to the bottom of the `## Index` block\n\n1. Index note exists, new `[[proj.four]]` created at time `12346`\n    - in this example, `proj.four` is added at the end of the index list\n    ```md\n    ---\n    id: ...\n    title: Projects\n    indexLastUpdated: 12346 \n    ---\n    <!-- Autogenerated Index Start -->\n    ## Index\n    - [[proj.one]]\n    - [[proj.two]]\n    - [[proj.three]]\n    - [[proj.four]]\n    <!-- Autogenerated Index End -->\n    ```\n1. Index note exists but is manually modified, new `[[proj.four]]` created at time `12346`\n  - before\n    ```md\n    ---\n    id: ...\n    title: Projects\n    indexLastUpdated: 12346 \n    ---\n    <!-- Autogenerated Index Start -->\n    ## Index\n    - [[proj.one]\n    - [[proj.two]]\n    - [[proj.three]]\n    ```\n  - after\n    ```md\n    ---\n    id: ...\n    title: Projects\n    indexLastUpdated: 12346 \n    ---\n    <!-- Autogenerated Index Start -->\n    ## Index\n    - [[proj.one]]\n    - [[proj.two]]\n    - [[proj.three]]\n    - [[proj.four]]\n    ```\n\n## FAQ\n\n### How does this behave in multi-vault?\n\nIn the initial verison, we will only generate index links to children that come from the same vault as the parent note. In the future, we might introduce an option to include multi-vault results\n\n### What happens if the direct child is a stub?\n\nBy default, Dendron will ignore [[stubs|dendron.concepts#stubs]] when scanning for indexes. This behavior can be changed with [[addStubs|dendron.rfc.18-index-notes#addstubs]]. If set, Dendron will create a note for any stubs encountered.\n\n## Config\n\n### indexHeaderName\n- default: index\n\nThe name of the index note\n\n### addStubs\n- default: false\n\nShould `Add Index` add entries to stubs\n\n## Discussion\n\n- Please leave feedback in [this github discussion](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/discussions/1076).\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/6TOh3VApIUfap7c3.html","relUrl":"notes/6TOh3VApIUfap7c3.html"},{"doc":"17 Rich Web Client","title":"17 Rich Web Client","hpath":"dendron.rfc.17-rich-web-client","content":"## Goals\n\nLaunch a rich web client for Dendron that comes with both read and write capabilities.\n\n## Context\n\nDendron is mainly used inside VSCode or a VSCode compatible editor today.

Added features and better UX can make tags more useful, improving note discoverability.\n\n## Context\n\n## Proposal\n\n### Hashtags\n\nHashtags should be recognized as tags. This makes it easier to input tags. For example, the following:\n\n```markdown\nBeatae porro aut vero aut in molestiae voluptas. #foo\n```\n\nShould have the same effect as:\n\n```markdown\nBeatae porro aut vero aut in molestiae voluptas. [[tags.foo]]\n```\n\n### Frontmatter tags\nBeing able to add tags in the frontmatter provides a more structured place for the tags, and also makes it possible to hide the tags from the body of the text itself.\n\n```markdown\n. . .\ncreated: 1624922522303\ntags: foo, bar\n---\n```\n\nFor example, for backlinks this should have the effect of adding `[[tags.foo]] [[tags.bar]]` to the note, except that the links of these tags will not appear inside of the text.\n\nIn preview and HTML, frontmatter tags should be displayed at the end of the note, like blog and news websites where tags will appear in a separate box at the start or end of a page.\nThis keeps tags from disrupting the text, while allowing users to discover other content with these tags.\n\n### Tag colors\n\nSetting colors for tags would make it quicker to recognize them at a glance, and would improve organization and aesthetics. Dendron should automatically generate distinct colors for tags, and users should be allowed to customize the tag colors.\n\nTag colors should be set in the frontmatter of the tag note:\n\n```\ndesc: ''\ntagColor: '#ff8524'\n```\n\nThe custom colors should allow hexadecimal RGB (`#FFAA88`), RGB (`rgb(24,135,240)`), RGBA (`rgba(255, 255, 255, .5)`), HSL (`hsl(100, 100%, 50%)`), HSLA (`hsla(235, 100%, 50%, .5)`), as well as [[color keywords|https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value#color_keywords]].\nThese colors are all widely supported in browsers, which means they should work both within publishing and preview without extra effort.\nOptionally, we can warn users for color options that are incorrect or not widely supported.\n\n### Tags in the graph view\n\n* Filter notes in the graph view by the tags they have\n* Tag many notes at once by selecting all of them (using frontmatter tags)\n\n### Tags in the tree view\n\nTags should get a special symbol in the tree view to set them apart, and the treeview should highlight them using the configured colors.\nTags should also get sorted to the top or the bottom of the tree view to make them easier to find at a glance.\n\n### Hiding tags in publishing\n\nTags should follow existing Dendron mechanisms for hiding notes, such as setting `published: false` in the frontmatter.\nOnce a tag is hidden, this should not only hide the tag note, but also hide this tag from being rendered in the frontmatter tags.\n\n## Details\n\n### Tag organization\n\nIt should be possible to organize tags using the hierarchy, such as `#quis.quidem`, `#quis.temporibus`.\nIf a parent tag in the hierarchy has a [[tag color|#tag-colors]] set or is [[hidden|#hiding-tags-in-publishing]], this should propagate to child tags.\n\nOrganizing tags makes it possible to set colors for a group of tags, and also allows the use of existing features like rename and refactor to control the tags.\n## Example\n\n## Tradeoffs\n\nHashtags are a pretty general syntax, reserving that syntax entirely for tags could be detrimental to future features (for example integration with Github issues, which look like `#123`).\n\n## Discussion\n\nPlease use the [RFC 16 Discussion Board](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/discussions/885) for any feedback.","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/NT1cFX6DRkTnzcWwduj2I.html","relUrl":"notes/NT1cFX6DRkTnzcWwduj2I.html"},{"doc":"15 Browser Based Dendron","title":"15 Browser Based Dendron","hpath":"dendron.rfc.15-browser-based-dendron","content":"\n## Goals\n\nCreating a quick way to launch Dendron with minimal setup will lower the \"Time to delight\" experienced by our customers. It also opens the potential for supporting the iPad and other similar tablets while ensuring the portability of your notes. \n\n## Context\nRight now, it requires multiple manual steps to run Dendron detailed in [[Getting Started|dendron.tutorial]]. We need to make it easy for someone to see the benefits of Dendron earlier in the product lifecycle. \n\n## Proposal\n\nThere are multiple ways of lowering time to delight:\n1. Create a one-click install-able custom build of VSCodium that supports Dendron out of the box. \n2. Update a build of Theia to support Dendron and host it. Also provides a client that can be installed separately.  \n3. Run a known good setup of Dendron and vscode using code-server. Provide a docker image that people use.  \n4. Host the code-server instance under dendron.so. \n\n## Phases\n\nPeople will want to sync their notes across multiple end-points. This needs to be as easy as a cloud-hosted solution. They also need to continue owning their notes like our current local-first, git-based approach. If we're careful not to sacrifice our local-first principle for the sake of ease-of-use, we can roll out a solution with a few checkpoints. \n\n1. Crawl: Provide a managed set of instructions so that Github hosted notes can be served if someone runs their own server. \n    - Details - can use [vivum lab](https://vivumlab.com/docs/Welcome) to potentially create a one-click install to a local server of the customers choice. \n2. Walk: Hosted notes can be accessed remotely. Managed deploy and provisioning to a remote server (AWS, Google Cloud).\n    - Details - Kubernetes to deploy to cloud-provider of choice. Could provide sign-in to multiple git-providers (Gitlab/Bitbucket. \n3. Run: Abstract away hosting altogether (but still support syncing notes with Github/Gitlab etc. so they're always accessible). Native clients (iOS, Android, Windows) that can sync with server and be eventually consistent with Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket etc.\n    - Details: Collaboration (through live-share) + review (through PRs) will not require a database implementation.  \n\n### References\n- https://github.com/cdr/code-server\n- https://theia-ide.org/\n    > Theia supports vscode extensions but may potentially face compatibility issues. \n- https://github.com/vivumlab/vivumlab\n \n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/65697e1b-ca70-4e6c-be0b-5e977afc9c7d.html","relUrl":"notes/65697e1b-ca70-4e6c-be0b-5e977afc9c7d.html"},{"doc":"14 - The Seed Bank","title":"14 - The Seed Bank","hpath":"dendron.rfc.14-seed-bank","content":"## Goals\n\nThe Seed Bank is an open database of [[workspaces|dendron.ref.workspace]] (seeds) that anyone can access and contribute to. \n\n## Context\n\nDendron's [mission](https://handbook.dendron.so/notes/8989a93d-8dde-4a51-bb8d-2aad761c93a1.html) is to help **people** organize and make sense of information. To that end, we want to make sure that both existing knowledge and newly created knowledge is not just easily accessible but comes with a degree of modularity that it becomes possible to compose existing information and build upon it. \n\nWhen working with code, the concepts of modules and packages are standard in every modern programming language - these abstractions make it possible to package frequently used code into re-usable modules. \n\nThe Dendron Seed Bank is an effort to do the same with knowledge.\n\n## [Lookup](https://handbook.dendron.so/notes/b89ba854-72fb-4ebc-a8a0-55960b89e9dc.html#lookup)\n\nPrior work that inspred this RFC\n\n- [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm)\n\n## Proposal\n\nThe Seed Bank needs to define the following components:\n\n1. specs\n   - standard metadata for declaring a module and its dependencies\n   - standard endpoint to retrieve said metadata\n   - standard methods to perform registry operations (add/remove/query)\n2. ~~registry~~\n   - an endpoint for hosting the registry metadata\n   - an endpoint for performing API calls against the registry\n   - an endpoint for hosting the module artifacts\n3. client\n   - a client that can talk to the registry endpoint\n\n## Details\n\n### Specs\n\nSee [[configuration|dendron.rfc.14-seed-bank.configuration]] for how metadata is stored in seeds\n\n### Registry\n\nSee [[Registry|dendron.rfc.14-seed-bank.registry]] for more information\n\n### Client\n\nRegistry client methods will be added to the [[dendron CLI|dendron.topic.cli]] under the `registry` namespace, or `reg` for short. \n\nWe will also add additional methods to the [[workspace command|dendron.topic.cli#workspace-command]] to be able to intiialize a workspace from an existing seed.\n\nSee [[methods|dendron.rfc.14-seed-bank.methods]] for the list of supported methods\n\n## Motivating Example\n\nYou are interestd in developing your own vscode plugin but don't know where to start. You have a workspace setup already. The following shows how to go about adding a hypothetical `vscode` seed using the CLI (a similar workflow will be availble when using the plugin )\n\n1. Look for any existing seeds to do with vscode using the CLI\n\n   ```sh\n   dendron seeds search vscode\n\n   name: dendron.vscode\n   desc: official vscode docs\n   ```\n2. Add the docs to your workspace\n\n   ```sh\n   dendron seeds add dendron.vscode\n\n   dendron.vscode has been added to your workspace\n   ```\n3. Inspect the schema\n\n   ```sh\n   dendron seeds schema dendron.vscode\n\n   # name of the schema \n   project:\n       nodes:\n           code: \n             quickstart: getting started\n             api: namespace(true)\n             ...\n   ```\n4. Query the notes\n   ```sh\n   dendron note lookup --query code.quickstart\n   ```\n5. Resulting configuration\n   - dendron.yml\n   ```yml\n   vaults:\n      # local vaults in your workspace\n      - ...\n      - fsPath: vault\n        seed: dendron.vscode\n   seeds:\n     # newly added seed\n     dendron.vscode:\n   ```\n   - dendorn.code-workspace\n   ```json\n   folders: [\n      {\n         \"path\": \"seeds/dendron.vscode/vault\",\n         \"name\": \"dendron.vscode/vault\"\n      },\n   ]\n   ```\n   - files\n   ```\n   .\n   └── workspace\n      ├── vault1\n      ├── ...\n      └── seeds\n         └── dendron.vscode\n               ├── dendron.yml\n               └── vault\n                  ├── dendron.md\n                  └── ...\n   \n   ```\n\n## Topics\n\n### Transitive Dependencies\n\n- [[Next Phase ⏩|dendron.ref.status#next-phase-]]\n\nLets say seed A depends on seed B and you install seed A\n\nDendron will pull in all dependencies of seed B as well as seed A\n\n### Publishing (website)\n\n- [[Next Phase ⏩|dendron.ref.status#next-phase-]]\n\nBy default, publishing is disabled for seeds. If you want to publish a seed, you can set its [[visibility|dendron.rfc.14-seed-bank.configuration#visibility]] to `public`. At this point, the standard publishing [[configuration|dendron.topic.publishing.configuration]] rules appyl.\n\nWhen you publish a seed, we will automatically add a banner at the top of any page that comes from a seed.\n\n```\nThis page is originally published by {author} and licensed under {license}\n```\n\nYou can disable this behavior by setting [[addAttribution|dendron.rfc.14-seed-bank.configuration#addattribution]] to `false`.\n\n## Phases\n\n### Phase I\n\n- [x] add registry [[configuration|dendron.rfc.14-seed-bank.configuration]] to `dendron.yml` [2021-06-15 15:55]\n- [x] add registry [[methods|dendron.rfc.14-seed-bank.methods]] to dendron cli [2021-06-15 15:55]\n- [x] add seed resolution logic when dendron initializes workspaces with seeds [2021-06-15 15:55]\n\n### Phase II\n\n- [ ] be able to publish seed vaults when publishing a website\n- [ ] convert seed bank from static file to API endpoint\n- [ ] support a self serve method of publishing to the registery\n\n### Future\n\n- [ ] versioning\n- [ ] support hosting a web version of seeds in the registry\n- [ ] dedup shared dependencies\n\n## Discussion\n\nAll discussions and feedback should be left in this [discussion thread](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/4039fc46-06b2-4f83-b817-fc490bafbcb3.html)\n\n## TradeOffs\n\n- Dendron dependency management is modelled after npm `node_modules`.

Many users currently use [[scratch note|dendron.topic.special-notes#scratch-note]] for tasks. \n\nWhile it can work, tasks have a lot of additional considerations like priority, ownership and due date that are hard to track in a consistent way using simple scratch notes. \n\nA common pattern for task is using the `[ ]` syntax to track completion\n\n```\n- [ ] todo1\n```\n\nThis works less well once the task becomes a scratch note that is present in multiple places\n```markdown\n\n<!-- weekly.journal.2021.01 --->\n- [ ] [[todo1|scratch.journal.2021.01.01.todo1]]\n...\n\n<!-- daily.journal.2021.01.01 --->\n- [ ] [[todo1|scratch.journal.2021.01.01.todo1]]\n...\n```\n\nAs a user, I know have to remember to check this task off in multiple places. \n\n## Proposal\n\nTo address previously mentioned issues, we introduce the concept of a **Task Note**. This is a new [[special note|dendron.topic.special-notes]] that is meant to make it easier to manage tasks in Dendron. \n\nThis RFC aims to implement the following functionality:\n- specify how to create and customize task notes\n- specify how to change the status of task notes\n- specify how to display task notes\n- specify how to create different views for task notes\n\n## Details\n\n### Creating a task note\n\nTask notes will be added to Dendron as a [[lookup modifier|dendron.topic.lookup.modifiers]] with the following default shortcuts:\n- `CMD+SHIFT+T` (mac)\n- `CTRL+SHIFT+T` (windows and linux)\n<!-- -->\n- NOTE: this conflicts with the built in shortcut to reopen a closed window\n\nBy default, task notes will be created as a child of the current note. For example, if the current note was `proj.build-a-cabin`, creating a task note would result in `proj.buid-a-cabin.task.{desc}` being created where `{desc}` is the human readable description of said note. \n\n### Customizing a task note\n\nTask notes have the same configuration as Dendron's other [[special notes|dendron.topic.special-notes#configuration]].\n\n\n#### notes.owner.hierarchy\n- default: `people`\n\nThe hierarchy for task owners. \n\n### Properties\n\nA task note has the following optional properties that can be set in the frontmatter\n\n```yml\ncompleted: boolean\ndue: date\nowner: string\npriority: L|M|H\ntags: [tag1, tag2]\n```\n\n#### completed\n\nIndicates whether the project is complete\n\n#### due\n\nDate indicating when the task is due\n\n#### owner\n\nThe individual responsible for the task\n\n#### priority\n\nThe priority of the given task\n\n#### tags\n\nTags for the given task\n\n### Log\n\nEvery time the status changes, it is updated in the log\n\n### Display\n\nWhen a task is completed, Dendron will create the following rendering\n\n```markdown\n<!-- raw markdown -->\n- [[proj.build-a-cabin]]\n\n<!-- rendered markdown in editor and preview-->\n- [x] [[proj.build-a-cabin]]  \n```\n\nNote that in the editor, the `[x]` will be rendered as a [Text Decorator](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#TextEditorDecorationType) which means it won't be part of the document but only appear as a visual indicator. \n\nUsing the same technique, Dendron can show the rest of the task properties using the text decorator trick. \n\n```yml\ncompleted: false\ndue: friday\nowner: kevin\npriority: H\ntags: [backend]\n```\n\n```markdown\n- [ ] [[proj.build-a-cabin]] due:friday @kevin prio:H #backend\n```\n\nHow a text note link is rendered can be configured using [[notes.task.render|dendron.rfc.13.todo-notes#notestaskrender]] property. \n\n## Configuration\n\n### notes.task.render\n- default: `- [{note.completed}] [{note.fname}] {% if due %} {% endif %}\n\n{% if posts.length %}\n{% else %}\n<i>No project posts yet!</i>\n{% endif %}\n\n## Example\n\n## Tradeoffs\n\n## Discussion","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/716e2699-42e1-44bd-9b97-124f03173ddc.html","relUrl":"notes/716e2699-42e1-44bd-9b97-124f03173ddc.html"},{"doc":"12 Schema Improvements","title":"12 Schema Improvements","hpath":"dendron.rfc.12-schema-improvements","content":"\n## Goals\n\nImprove the abilitys of schemas.\n\n## Context\n\n(feel free to request the links I should add here)\n\n## Proposal\n\nThis is a proposal of multiple features, each indivitual feature will have its own page.

Your own may be more like a namespaces and being free from.\n\nBut the ones in your Workvaults, have the same Project schema but being more strict. Now you would need to split your Workspace into Work and Personal.\nThe next Problem could be that each Team would want to extend the Work Project scheme with team specific Hierachys which would not really be possible at the moment. \n\n## Goal\n\nThe goal should be in a first step to make it possible to specify if a schema in a vault should have Priority for this vault, making it Possible to have a Schema Vault that contains shared schemas and having schemas inside in each vault that can override the schared Schemas.\n\nThe next Step in this could be to make it possible to extend schemas. Making schemas more useable in general. See [[Reusability|dendron.rfc.12-schema-improvements.reusability]] for this.  \n\n## Proposal\n\nWe can go two ways with this way one would be to just introduce a field `priority` for schemas that, can be `default` to set it as default for all vaults in this workspace and if it is not set it overrides the `default` schema for this vault if it is not set. Other values could be a vault name it applies to or a list of Vaultnames that it applies to. \n\nThe second way could be to intruduce a vault specific config file `dendron.yaml` that has a `schema` field that lists all schemas of the vault with information of their `priority`\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/fa3b1186-b50f-4b7e-9c46-2a116bfdde51.html","relUrl":"notes/fa3b1186-b50f-4b7e-9c46-2a116bfdde51.html"},{"doc":"UI Options","title":"UI Options","hpath":"dendron.rfc.12-schema-improvements.ui-options","content":"\n## Goal\n\nImproving schema cababilitys to influence the UI Elements of Dendron.\n\n## Proposal\n\n1.  One Part of this would be the ability to specify an Icon that is associated with the schema and gets shown in the Dendron Treeview instead of the current Book Icon. \n    Additionaly these icons can be shown when publisched in the navigation and links to notes that match a schema.  \n2. The ability to specify Colors that should be used as background in the treeview or as color for the note in the Graphview, but with the ability to specify colors for each VSCodetheme.\n\n\n## Example\n\n```yml\nschemas:\n    dendron:\n        id: dendron\n        icon: 'dendron://assets/foo.svg'\n        color:\n            light: lightgreen\n            dark: darkgreen            \n```\n\nYes I was to lazy to adjust each Item under Dendron to the background color.\nSince it is not as straight forward as I have thought. \n\n![](/assets/images/2021-05-16-11-38-06.png) \n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/72d4dbde-59f6-463b-bcd8-2de3457af96f.html","relUrl":"notes/72d4dbde-59f6-463b-bcd8-2de3457af96f.html"},{"doc":"Types","title":"Types","hpath":"dendron.rfc.12-schema-improvements.types","content":"\n## Goals\n\nCreating the possibility to extend the functionality of schemas by introducing a type value on them.\n\n## Proposal\n\nAdding a type value to schemas, this value would be optional and default to the current functionality. \nThe current functionality should be named `pattern` in my eyes and be the default value for this key in the yaml. \n\nThese Types should implement a common Interface to be used by dendron, specifying the Keys of the schema Object they handle and Specify a Json Schema to validate against.\nDendron should provide ways for the diffrent types of extensions it recognizes to contribute their own types, that implement the common Interface.\nA type registered this way would be used by `{extensionName}:{typeName}` inside the `*.schema.yaml` files. This allows for flexibility with extending the functionality of Dendron.\n\n\n### Proposed Types\n\nThe following are Types that I would Propose to create as part of dendrons core functionality.\n\n#### Pattern\n\nThis would be the current functionality. The examples show that they are Equal \n\n##### Example\n\n```yml\nschemas:\n  - id: example\n    title: Example #defaults to the id\n    pattern: e #defaults to the id if not set\n```\n\n```yml\nschemas:\n  - id: example\n    title: Example #defaults to the id\n    pattern: e #defaults to the id if not set\n    type: pattern\n```\n\n#### Segments\n\nThe purpose of segments could be twofold one would be to merge multiple hierarchy levels into one overall hierachy level. \n\nOr splitting one Hierachy level into multiple levels. \n\n\n##### Example\n\n\n```yml\nschemas:\n  - id: date\n    title: Example #defaults to the id\n    type: segments \n    pattern: $0.$1.$2 # this Key would be optional and default would be to concate the Patterns of the schemas in the elements array, the ${digit} part describes the hierachy lvl in this scheme, but could use named identifiers as well or static pattern parts. A dot represents a Dot in the filename. \n    elements: # required for segments, order matters here if number references are used.    \n      - id: year # this would match the reference $0 or $year\n      - id: month # this would match the reference $1 or $month\n      - id: day # this would match the reference $2 or $day        \n```\n\n\n\n#### Enum\n\nThis type extends the Pattern type with the option to map the matched values of the Pattern to a title that should be used in the UI.\n\nAdditionaly we Could extend it to provide a way to conditionaly change the Children depending on what gets matched. \nExampel being here the pattern for the day to reflect the actual days of the month.\n\n##### Example\n\n```yml\nschemas:\n   - id: numericMonth\n     type: enum\n     pattern: (0[1-9])|(1[0-2]) # A valid pattern is required that can match multiple things.\n     matches: # each matchs entry is required to be a valid option for the pattern\n        - 01: Januar # the first part is the matched value and the second part becomes the title\n        - 02: Februar\n        - 03: March  # not every possible match needs to be provided if no match is provided the matched value becomes the title.\n```\n\n\n#### Group\n\nThis type would allow someone to define multiple Schemas for one hierachy level That get grouped under a commen Key.\n\n##### Example\n\n```yml\nschemas:\n   - id: Month\n     type: group\n     schemas: # Requires a non empty list of either schema definitions or references. \n        - numericMonth # reference of a defined schema would be valid.\n        - id: shortLetterMonth # can contain the specification of a new schema\n\n```\n\n\n\n#### Heading\n\nThis type is meant to specify the headings of a Note and would apply to Schemas that it is a child of. This should be seen like an interface for the developers. Multiple heading type schemas can exist on one schema. The Order of the Headings in the note is not Relevant. \n\n##### Example \n\n```yml\nschemas:\n   - id: tasklist\n     type: headings\n     children: # each children is either a direct match or a RegEx that must match\n        - open \n        - planned\n        - done\n```\n\n\n\n#### Extension:Type\n\nThis would be how an Extension provided Type could be used.\n\n##### Example\n\n```yaml\nschemas:\n    - id: jiraIssue\n      type: 'jiraPod:issue'\n      # here would then be a list of settings for this type \n      # example could be\n      projectSlug: /[A-Z]{3}/ #The pattern to match the Project slug\n      issueId: /[1-9][0-9]*/ #The Pattern to macht the Id\n      issueState: # The States of the issue \n        - opened\n        - in work\n        - to review\n        - done\n```\n\n### Common Interface\n\nEach Type needs to implement a certain interface providing dendron with functionality to handle the nodes acordingly.\n\n#### Example\n\nJust an example how it could look, feel free to provide other implementation examples.\n```ts\nenum SortingDirections{\n    ascending,\n    decending\n};\nenum DNavigationType{\n    sibling,\n    level\n};\nenum SiblingNavigationDirection{\n    previous,\n    next\n}\nenum LevelNavigationDirection{\n    up,\n    down\n}\ntype NavigationDirection = SiblingNavigationDirection|LevelNavigationDirection; \ntype NavigationFunction<T> = (node:T, direction:NavigationDirection)=>T;\n\ntype SortingFunction<T> = (left:T,right:T)=> number;\ntype MatchFunction<T> = (hierachy:string, args:T)=>boolean;\ninterface Node {} // Placeholder \n\ninterface ISchemaType {\n        \n    getTypeName() : string; // The Name of the Type\n    \n    getSchemaKeys() : string[]; // The Schema Keys that this Type requires for\n    \n    getSortingDirections():SortingDirections[]; // The Sort Directions this Type provides.

Obsidian has a great implementation of this already - unless there are critical deficiencies, we should adhere to their implementation and strive for interoperability. \n\n## Concepts\n\n### Block Links\n\nA block link has the following format. It is created in a note that is referencing a piece of text. When navigating the link, users should be taken to the block anchor. \n\n```\n[[somelink#^1234]]\n```\n\n### Block Anchor\n\nA block anchor is a `^` character, followed by one or more digits, letters, dashes, and underscores. Dendron should automatically generate these anchors when requested, and users should be able to add in custom anchors. The following are a few examples of anchors:\n\n```\nLorem ipsum dolor amet ^1234\n\n* Item 1\n* Item 2 ^second-item\n* Item 3\n\n^whole-list\n\n| Sapiente | accusamus |\n|----------|-----------|\n| Laborum  | libero    |\n| Ullam    | optio     | ^whole-table\n```\n\n`^whole-list`, `^whole-table`, and `^1234` reference the blocks they are attached to. Lists are special though, `^second-item` only references the list item it is next to.\n\n### Block Reference Link\n\nA block reference link is a reference to a block link. \n\n```\n![[somelink#^1234]]\n```\n\n#### Block Range References\n\nBlock references should also support [[range references|dendron.topic.references#block-range-reference]]. Any valid block anchor is also a valid target for the start or end of a range.\n\nWhen referring to block anchors, the range will be inclusive on both ends. For example:\n\n```\nparagraph 1\n\nparagraph 2 ^start\n\nparagraph 3 ^end\n\nparagraph 4\n\n![[#^start:^end]]\n```\n\nThe reference here will include both paragraph 2 and 3. A single paragraph can be referenced without the range.\n\nThe range can also refer to anchors inside lists.

Native Preview Experience","title":"1 - Native Preview Experience","hpath":"dendron.rfc.1-dendron-nextjs","content":"\n## Why\n- remove Markdown Preview Enhanced (MPE) dependency\n    - MPE has a huge surface area and we only use a small part of its feature set\n    - MPE is a sizable download (40mb) with performance issues on startup and a few other cases\n    - MPE is based on `markdown-it` whereas dendron is based on `remarkable`\n        - this makes our features sets incompatible and makes a lot of the MPE code base unsuitable for extension\n        - this also causes notes in the preview to render differently from code in the browser\n- use next.js for markdown preview\n    - next.js is already used in Dendron webviews (eg. `Dendron: Configure`) and the plan is to convert all UI components to webviews\n    - next.js lets us add rich visualizations based on React and the latest web technologies\n    - next.js will let us eventually use MDX \n    - next.js can eventually be used as a scaffold for our own web client or dedicated desktop client \n\n## Goals with v1\n- [x] use next.js to do local preview of dendron notes\n\n### Stretch Goals\n- [ ] scroll sync\n- [ ] use next.js to preview dendron site\n- [ ] better preview for schemas\n\n### Additional Features\n- [ ] folding of headers\n\n## Future Goals\n- use next.js to provide WYSWYG experience for dendron notes\n- incorporate native lookup inside Dendron\n\n## Considerations\n- we currently render notes into HTML for publication with 11ty. it seems like duplicate effort to re-create this in next.js\n    - ideally, want to either serve the static assets from 11ty using next.js or use next.js to generate the static assets\n    - kevin's thoughts: I like to be able to use next.js for everything down the line (static site generation + preview) but it might make more sense presently to implement a vscode specific preview and then figure out how to merge 11ty and next.js afterwards\n- Dendron currently uses express as a backend\n    - we generate static assets from next.js at compile time using `next export` and then serve them over express\n    - Moving forward, if we want to use next.js for preview generation, we will probably need to swap out express with next.js \n    - reason we currently have the next.js/express split is because `next dev` dynamically re-compiles each route one at a time which causes our integration tests to fail (our integration tests call on the APIs from express ) and next.js causes the initial call to fail\n    - we'll need to either find a workaround in next.js our use next.js [custom server functionality](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-server) to embed express \n    - kevin's thought: use custom server functionality. we'll lose out on some next.js code splitting features but should give us the best of both worlds otherwise\n\n## Tasks\n- [ ] bundle next.js with dendron using custom router\n- [ ] add api to dendron engine to preview a note\n- [ ] update `Dendron: Show Preview` command to call API with current note\n\n## Related\n\n- [Code for rendering webview currently](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/plugin-core/src/commands/ConfigureWithUI.ts#L6:L6)\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/17c61d62-f92e-4002-b8fe-9c05686e4bf9.html","relUrl":"notes/17c61d62-f92e-4002-b8fe-9c05686e4bf9.html"},{"doc":"Releases","title":"Releases","hpath":"dendron.release","content":"\n\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/932534e7-e788-4fdb-bc8c-eaf761992a8d.html","relUrl":"notes/932534e7-e788-4fdb-bc8c-eaf761992a8d.html"},{"doc":"Changelog","title":"Changelog","hpath":"dendron.release.changelog","content":"\n## 0.59.3\n\n### Features\n- @kaan feat(publish): nextjs publishing supports fulltext search (#1334)\n\n\n### Enhancements\n- @joshi enhance(publish): Add Google Analytics to Published Site (#1300)\n- @joshi enhance(pods): various github pod improvements ([[docs|dendron.topic.pod.builtin.github-issue]]) (#1345)\n  -

We have now finished migrating all existing lookup features to the new commands and have switched to using it for all lookup related operations. \n\nThere shouldn't be any noticable difference in your daily workflow, but there are some breaking changes that needs to be addressed described below.\n\n### Enhancements\n- notes: wildcard anchors will now work at the end of a note, addresses following [issue]((https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/pull/1158))\n- notes: avoid parsing notes that are too large\n- workspace: better error message when trying to refactor notes without frontmatter\n- publishing: breadcrumbs are now clicakble\n\n### Bug Fixes\n- notes: note reference inserting title of note in preview\n- preview: horizontal line not rendering in preview\n- publishing: internal links pointing to bad url\n\n### Breaking Changes\n\n#### Changes to custon keyboard shortcuts.\nIf you are using custom keyboard shortcuts to provide different arguments to the lookup command, these are the breaking changes that need to be addressed:\n\n1. All keyboard shortcuts referencing `\"command\": \"dendron.lookup\"` should be updated to reference `\"command\": \"dendron.lookupNote\"` instead.\n1. There are some changes to the arguments you can provide to the lookup command:\n    - `flavor` argument is deprecated. Note Lookup and Schema Lookup are two separate commands now.\n    - `noteExistBehavior` argument is deprecated.\n    - `filterType` has been renamed to `filterMiddleware`, and requires an array of strings instead of a string.\n    - `value` has been renamed to `initialValue`.\n    - `effectType` has been broken down to individual arguments:\n      - `multiSelect` and `copyNoteLink`.\n      - `copyNoteRef` keyword has been deprecated.\n\nPlease note that providing an incorrect argument to the keyboard shortcut will not prevent you from using that keybinding, but the argument will not be properly passed. This will result in a different behavior than you would expect. Please make sure to update them if you are using them.\n\nYou can find a reference to all the available lookup modifiers [[here|dendron.topic.lookup.modifiers]]\n\n### House Cleaning\n- migrate all Lookup tests to NoteLookup and Schema lookup\n\n## 0.55.1\n\n### Bug Fixes\n- copy note url command not working\n\n## 0.55\n\n## 0.54.2\n\n### Features\n#### Insert Note Index Command\n![[dendron.topic.commands#insert-note-index,1:#*]]\n\n### Enhancements\n- resolve wikilinks with `siteUrl` when using the Markdown Publish Pod ([[docs|dendron.topic.pod.builtin.markdown.publish#config]])\n\n### Bug Fixes\n- escaping from lookup can cause next lookup to be run twice\n\n## 0.54.1\n\n### Features\n\n#### General Release of the Calendar Widget\nThe [[Calendar View|dendron.ref.web-ui#calendar-view]] is no longer hidden behind a feature flag and is now ready for general usage.\n\n#### Validation and autocomplete for dendron.yml\n![[dendron.topic.config.dendron#validation-and-autocomplete,1:#*]]\n\n### Enhancements\n- bring [[Lookup Note|dendron.topic.commands#lookup-note]] to feature parity with existing lookup\n    - add schema suggestions\n    - show current Dendron version\n    - apply journal title override\n- Colored tags in the tree view ([[docs|dendron.topic.tags#custom-colors]])\n- Tags inherit color of ancestors ([[docs|dendron.topic.tags#custom-colors]])\n- Add leading slash to markdown links during export \n\n### Bug Fixes\n- calendar: errors when switching between month/year\n- copy note link copies footnotes as anchors\n- NoteLookup gets old selection in some cases\n- missing tutorial warning when initializing a blank workspace\n- direct child filter can miss results \n\n## 0.54\n\n## 0.53.3\n\n### Features\n\n#### Github Publish Pod\n- ![[dendron.topic.pod.builtin.github-issue.publish#summary,1:#*]]\n\n#### Custom Colors for Tags\n- [[Customizable tag colors|dendron.topic.tags#custom-tag-colors]] to color code your tags\n\n#### Rename Header Command\n- [[Rename Header Command|dendron.topic.commands#rename-header]] which updates links to that header\n\n### Enhancements\n- automatically resolve conflicting keybinding caused by vim extension\n\n### Bug Fixes\n- lookup was not setting [[splitType|dendron.topic.lookup.modifiers#splittype]] when executed with a custom keybinding\n\n### Pruning\n- we removed `journal.firstDayOfWeek` as a property from the web ui calendar. see details [here](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/pull/1065/files)\n\n### House Cleaning\n\n### Docs\n\n## 0.53.2\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- fix missing dependency in dendron-cli\n\n## 0.53.1\n\n### Features\n\n#### Frontmatter Tags\n\n![[Frontmatter tags|dendron.topic.tags#frontmatter-tags:#pretty-tags]]\n\n#### Seed Commands\n\nSeed Commands now available within the extension. You can add seeds to your workspace with the `Dendron: Seed Add` command, which was previously only available in the CLI.\n\n![[dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.topic.commands#seed-add:#Misc]]\n\n#### Better Lookup\n\nWe are splitting up the `Lookup` command into two separate commands: [[Lookup Note|dendron.topic.commands#lookup-note]] and [[Lookup Schema|dendron.topic.commands#lookup-schema]]. There's been a lot of confusion that has come from overloading the `Lookup` command which is now deprecated and will removed in a future release. \n\nBesides for the split, [[Lookup Note|dendron.topic.commands#lookup-note]] should be significantly faster for large workspaces. Previously you might have noticed a lag when creating a new note in these cases. It also comes with a the new [[vaultSelection|dendron.topic.lookup.modifiers#vaultselection]] modifier that lets you prompt for a vault when creating a new note.\n\n### Enhancements\n- Google Docs Pod will now prompt users to confirm overwriting of a document before running with the [[confirmOverwrite configuration.|dendron.topic.pod.builtin.google-docs.import#confirmoverwrite]]\n- When choosing between vaults (for example, picking which vault to put a note in), the vaults will now show by the vault name instead of the vault path.\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- Fixed an issue where wikilinks were not getting highlighted\n- Fixed an issue with the doctor command's regenerate note ID feature\n- Fixed broken links in the extension readme\n- Add Vault command in the CLI will now properly modify your workspace file ^sZzM7QHk4i5m\n\n## 0.53\n\n## 0.52.2\n\n### Enhancements\n- Lots of graph improvements\n  - Labels are now hidden in large graphs \n  - Better layout for large graphs\n  - Loading indicators when starting graph\n  - Better error messages\n  - Better configuration toggling\n\n### Bug Fixes\n- Inconsistent cross-vault link behavior has been fixed\n- Better behavior for hashtags with periods at the end\n\n### House Cleaning\n- windows integration tests are now active \n\n## 0.52.1\n\n### Bug Fixes\n- Issue with publishing from plugin \n\n## 0.52\n\n## 0.51.4\n\n### Features\n\n#### Deprecate Markdown Preview Enhanced\n\nDendron Markdown Preview Enhanced is no longer required to use Dendron. \n\nBy default, all new users will get [[Preview V2|dendron.topic.preview-v2]] as the default. Existing users that have not turned on V2 will see no change but can and are encourage to switch to preview v2 by following the instructions [[here|dendron.topic.preview-v2#uninstall-dendron-markdown-preview-enhanced]]. Dendron Markdown Preview Enhanced should now be considered deprecated and subject to removal later this year. \n\n### Enhancements\n- control graph zoom sensiitivity\n\n## 0.51.3\n\n### Features\n\n#### Google Doc Import Pod\n![[dendron.topic.pod.builtin.google-docs.import#summary,1:#*]]\n\n### Enhancements\n- selection modiifier to NoteLookup Command\n- delay frontmatter warning while user is typing\n\n### Bug Fixes\n- autocomplete takes a long time \n\n## 0.51.2\n### Features\n\n#### Non-Blocking Workspace initialization\n\nWhen you open a Dendron workspace, you might have noticed that you needed to wait for the workspace to initialize before VSCode itself became usable. This is because even though Dendron uses a local server to index your files, this server ran on the same process as VSCode. \n\nWe have offloaded the local server to a separate process so that all engine operations (eg. indexing) no longer affect the main VSCode process. \n\nWhat this means in practice is that you can use VSCode immediately when the workspace is open. It also means you'll notice better responsiveness across all engine related features (eg. refactoring, preview, etc)\n\n### Enhancements\n- find missing links in entire workspace  ([[docs|dendron.topic.commands#createmissinglinkednotes]])\n- hide the filter view in the note graph \n- warn against missing frontmatter ([[docs|dendron.topic.commands#fixfrontmatter]])\n- hashtag autocomplete improvements ([[docs|dendron.topic.tags#autocomplete-intellisense]])\n- doctor command to automatically fix the frontmatter ([[docs|dendron.topic.commands#fixfrontmatter]])\n\n### Bug Fixes\n- hashtag links duplicate following text\n- issues with parsing wikilinks with unicode and special symbols\n\n### House Cleaning\n\n## 0.51.1\n\n### Enhancements\n- reduce size of dendron-cli\n\n## 0.51\n\n## 0.50.2\n\n### Features\n\n#### Custom Graph Syliing\n![[dendron.topic.graph-view#custom-styling,1:#*]]\n\n#### Built-In Note Templates\n\nThis experimental feature will allow you to pull down a set of templates for commonly used scenarios. The template selection is currently limited, but we will be expanding on the template set in the future.\n\n![[dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.topic.templates#built-in-templates-,1]]\n\n\n### Enhancements\n- show preview will no longer ask you to load\n\n### Bug Fixes\n- dendron not updating journal behavior based on journal config in dendron.yml\n\n### Pruning\n\n### House Cleaning\n\n### Docs\n\n\n## 0.50.1\n\n### Features\n\n#### Backlink Candidates\n\n![[dendron.topic.links#candidate-backlink:#*]]\n\n#### Smart hierarchy selection when creating notes with multiple vaults\n\nThe behavior around selecting which vault to create a note in has been improved for multi-vault workspaces. If the new note matches an existing hierarchy in a different vault, a prompt will come up with vault suggestions for your new note.\n\n![[Vault Location when Creating a Note|dendron.topic.vaults.multi-vault#vault-location-when-creating-a-note:#navigating-links]]\n\n#### Hashtag support \n\n![[dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.topic.tags#summary,1:#*]]\n\n#### Preview V2 Enhancements\n\nAlmost at feature parity with current preview.

To reference a header, use `![[note#foo]]`. This changes makes our note ref syntax more consistent with our wiki link syntax.\n\nNote that the new ref syntax expects a [[sluggified|dendron.ref.terms#slug]] header. This is done automatically when you use the updated [[copy note ref|dendron.topic.commands#copy-note-ref]] command.\n\nThis change makes it possible to create a ref to a header with special characters.\n\nThe old syntax ref syntax will still work but should now be considered deprecated. We will release a `doctor` command to help you auto-upgrade from the old syntax to the new syntax in the coming week.\n\n#### Frontmatter Variable Substitution\n\nIt is now possible to use variables defined in your note frontmatter inside your note. The syntax is `{{fm.VAR_NAME}}` where `VAR_NAME` is the name of your variable. The `fm` designates that you want to use a frontmatter variable.\n\n<!--\n#### Publishing V2 Integration with Plugin\n\nYou can now both build your notes for publication and preview it from inside vscode.\n\n![[dendron.topic.commands#site-build:#dev]]\n-->\n\n### Enhancements\n\n-   `nav_exclude` property excludes from nav sider and table of contents ([[docs|dendron.topic.publishing.navigation#nav-exclude]])\n-   [[copy note ref|dendron.topic.commands#copy-note-ref]] command will use the new note ref syntax\n-   footnote support in preview and when publishing ([[docs|dendron.topic.markdown#footnotes]])\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n-   spaces in wiki link not rendering in preview\n\n## 0.22.2\n\n### Enhancements\n\n-   better fuzzy search for lookup\n-   publishing v2 enhancements\n    -

Dendron currently publishes using [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) using our own [template](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron-jekyll). While this has served as well initially, slow compile times for large sites and difficulty of getting started has made it a growing pain point.\n\nTo address this, we've migrated our publishing stack to [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), a super fast javascript based static generator. This means much faster, and perhaps more importantly, easier publishing.\n\nThere's still some work left to integrate publishing into the Dendron plugin - meanwhile, you can take the new publishing workflow for a spin using the [[dendron cli|dendron.topic.cli]]\n\nIn order to to use the 11ty based publishing, initialize your workspace with the following commands.\n\n```bash\nnpm init -y\nnpm install @dendronhq/dendron-cli@latest\nnpm install @dendronhq/dendron-11ty@latest\n```\n\nAfter you have your dependencies installed, build your your site using the following command.\n\n```bash\nnpx dendron-cli buildSiteV2 --wsRoot .  --stage dev --serve\n```\n\nThis will both compile your site locally and make it available at `localhost:8080` for instant preview. When building your site locally, the pages will be build to `{wsRoot}/build/site`.\n\nWhen you are ready to publish to github, make sure to change the stage to `prod`.\n\n```bash\nnpx dendron-cli buildSiteV2 --wsRoot .  --stage prod\n```\n\nThis will build your site to the path specified by [[siteRootDir|dendron.topic.publishing-legacy.configuration#siterootdir]] in `dendron.yml`.\n\n#### Benchmarks\n\nPublishing V2 is ~10x faster than jekyll based publishing for sites with +100 pages. For comparison, below is the compilation difference between building the dendron site using 11ty vs jekyll.\n\n-   11ty: 24.45s\n-   jekyll: 220.33s\n\nThere are additional optimizations still on the table that will further drive down he compilation time by another order of magnitude for future releases.\n\n#### Gaps\n\n11ty publishing is currently not at full feature parity with Jekyll publishing. Notably, the following features are missing:\n\n-   setting a custom color theme\n-   `edit on github` links\n-   `jekyll-seo` functionality\n-   mathjax\n\n#### Migration\n\nAll values that used to be written into `_config.yml` will now be moved into `dendron.yml`. You can see the currently supported configuration values here: `https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/common-all/src/types/typesv2.ts`\n\nIf you currently have a Jekyll based Dendron page, note that the following settings have changed:\n\n-   the `url` property from `_config.yml` is now `siteUrl` in `dendron.yml`\n-   favicon is now controlled by `siteFaviconPath` in `dendron.yml` and is a path relative to your workspace root\n-   `CNAME` is now controlled by `githubCname` property in `dendron.yml`\n\n#### Sample dendron.yml config\n\n-   publishing without a cname\n\n```yml\nversion: 1\nvaults:\n    - fsPath: vault\nsite:\n    copyAssets: true\n    siteHierarchies:\n        - dendron\n    siteRootDir: docs\n    siteUrl: \"kevinslin.github.io/dendron-11ty-test\"\n    usePrettyRefs: true\n```\n\n-   using custom cname\n\n```yml\nversion: 1\nvaults:\n    - fsPath: vault\nsite:\n    copyAssets: true\n    siteHierarchies:\n        - dendron\n    siteRootDir: docs\n    usePrettyRefs: true\n    siteUrl: \"11ty.dendron.so\"\n    githubCname: \"11ty.dendron.so\"\n```\n\n#### Sample repo\n\n-   [github repo](https://github.com/kevinslin/dendron-11ty-test/deployments/activity_log?environment=github-pages)\n-   [github page](https://kevinslin.github.io/dendron-11ty-test/)\n\n#### CLI Command Reference\n\n```bash\ndendron-cli buildSiteV2\n\nbuild notes for publication using 11ty\n\nOptions:\n  --version  Show version number                                       [boolean]\n  --help     Show help                                                 [boolean]\n  --wsRoot   location of workspace                                    [required]\n  --vaults   location of vault                                           [array]\n  --serve    serve over local http server             [boolean] [default: false]\n  --stage    serve over local http server\n```\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/0eq1mz_b-gpdSZVJqruOg.html","relUrl":"notes/0eq1mz_b-gpdSZVJqruOg.html"},{"doc":"0.1.X","title":"0.1.X","hpath":"dendron.release.changelog.0-1-x","content":"## 0.19.3\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- be able to name remote vaults ([6da3973](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/6da39730f735f4700479f002f57d2a7802398ff5))\n- doctor command shouldn't create stubs ([e812f34](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/e812f34246d88b007fb45ca03443a74ac27a5e62))\n- help command not working ([02fc08a](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/02fc08a907e196b39c23db36b82565c15588673f))\n- nested git repos not showing up in source control view ([37adc5e](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/37adc5e528e0b9fa6c86105b39ebb40384023da4))\n- clicking a stub on tree view would show a false error ([ea0e17e](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/ea0e17e7ec8afed44cee1fd0fe442ba4c2064f92))\n\n## 0.19.2\n\n### Features\n\n#### Dendron Seed Bank\n\n![[dendron.topic.seed-bank]]\n\n#### Support refactor for multi-vault\n\nOne of our most requested features for multi-vault is now out. Refactor will now work across multiple vaults. All rename operations take place in the same vault as the file being renamed (so a refactor operation that affects files in multiple vaults will end up renaming files within each vault). You can see an example of this below:\n\n```\n.\n├── vault1\n│   └── bond.one\n└── vault2\n    └── bond.two\n```\n\n- after refactoring `bond -> james`\n\n```\n.\n├── vault1\n│   └── james.one\n└── vault2\n    └── james.two\n```\n\n#### Support Specifying Vault Location when Creating a Note\n\n![[dendron.topic.vaults.multi-vault#specify-vault-location-when-creating-a-note,1:#*]]\n\n### Enhancements\n\n- add aws to the seed bank ([818bc05](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/818bc0510e3b3b99057ef7cda8d9c61be2b6ebc6))\n- nicer refactor formatting ([0e7749a](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/0e7749a175a0ce80903cde5c9773649779100a9c))\n- add remote vault to gitignore if exist ([1c252db](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/1c252db60c0ea69be8dd10c1768c2dd302711e13))\n- initialize all remote vaults on startup ([1919fe4](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/1919fe4e6d853d1f6ef63564ebbcc9af1e11a41a))\n- write remote url to dendron config ([2a285ea](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/2a285eacaeef8224d2a3530dc991b4977443c039))\n- add github sponsor badge on github repository to recruit more [[environmentalists|dendron.community.roles#environmentalist]] 👨‍🌾 👩‍🌾\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- completion on schema suggestions ([223d6a5](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/223d6a501bd9e51331d28e21d77408b7ca3fba50))\n\n## 0.19.1\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- image preview regex match wrong range \n\n## 0.18.2\n\n### Features\n\n- support image hover ([8fee313](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/8fee313785dfc4ac2564f74911a4b51879be0673))\n\n  ```\n  - you can now hover over markdown image links and get the image preview\n  ```\n\n  <div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 62.5%; height: 0;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.loom.com/embed/82119bc9ee184e3ca8e619c3d7e48209\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\"></iframe></div>\n\n### Enhancements\n\n- faster completion ([d9d4598](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/d9d4598c1996fdb5eb24e4bda0e51e777b476f6e))\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- doctor errors when backfilling frontmatter ([862e917](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/862e9173e92a2e5d964273bb87c19e79177a6200))\n- properly parsing links that start at beginning of line ([b2dbdfc](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/b2dbdfc9e49aa1fa74d5097500eeaddf05bf7ccc))\n- limit completion prompts to inside wiki links ([f49972e](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/f49972ee436f9f637bd68729e702ba2169e68faf))\n- adding local vault with fail if using relative path ([fb202e9](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/fb202e91e501cfd5506fd73c9a005807954e48d3))\n- make completion match the whole link ([d9d4598](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/d9d4598c1996fdb5eb24e4bda0e51e777b476f6e))\n- tree view containing out of date hierarchy\n- alias notes will no longer display alias portion as part of the link when publishing\n\n## 0.18.1\n\n### Features\n\n#### Support adding remote vaults\n\n- commit: ([d7501b9](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/d7501b9a5cb116faae64d26798cfd7ccfc73a4b0))\n\nYou can now natively add published Dendron git repos as a _remote vault_ inside Dendron. These vaults are stored in a custom `repos` folder underneath your `workspaceRoot`. Since a remote vault is just a git repo, you are able to perform all the usual git operations on it like `push`, `pull`, `merge`, and `blame`. \n\n<div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 62.5%; height: 0;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.loom.com/embed/ef3fa948460c4f2cb4f7a7b8242579d1\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\"></iframe></div>\n\n### Enhancements\n\n- support pods for multi-vault ([661fe21](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/661fe218d448e6f32f86bf60dabe635b71d67251))\n- much faster lookup performance for large vaults 🚀🚀🚀  ([3ddeba8](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/3ddeba8a596be4bc9316e0cc5e63025d7bf4460f))\n- support [[sibling nav|dendron.topic.commands#go-next-sibling]] for multi-vault ([235bfc7](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/235bfc77505b403bf32c78ce3df6b7005c37dfba))\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- publishing fails in some cases when multi-vault is enabled ([0ebac81](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/0ebac8191291f48ab42fbc30279e9615c96a5245))\n- journal and scratch notes fail in some cases for multi-vault ([5c04ccd](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/5c04ccd666511abb79554b7a24c02efd46d93c3a))\n- multiple commands not working properly for multi-vault([fd5a381](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/fd5a381674384588850b07b193fc0bf609abc0fd))\n\n### House Cleaning\n\n- breaking: the [[go to sibling|dendron.topic.commands#go-next-sibling]] commands have a new keyboard shortcut since the old one was conflicting with the vscode default. the new shortcuts are `ctrl+shift+]` and `ctrl+shift+[`\n\n## 0.17.2\n\n### Features\n\n#### Dendron Web UI 🚧\n\nDuring office hours and onboardings, many of you said how you loved Dendron's functionality but wished that it was a little easier to use, especially on the UI front.\n\nThis is why I'm excited to introduce Dendron's first Web UI - an interface build using modern web technologies integrated into VSCode. \n\nThis initial launch features the Dendron Configuration editor. Prior to the UI, you would have to manually edit YAML to update the configuration. With the web ui, you no longer have to understand YAML and your changes will be validated before being saved. \n\nThe configuration editor is just the first step in making Dendron easier to use and expect to see more updates on this front soon.\n\nNote that the Web UI is still deemed experimental and functionality like keyboard shortcuts currently don't work.\n\nSpecial thanks to [Tyler Nieman](https://github.com/tsnieman) for the UI work!\n\n![[dendron.topic.commands#configure,1:#*]]\n\n### Enhancements\n\n- update config commands ([44dce76](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/44dce76b6fd447cd29a2f4f594632ef758eff927))\n- enable rename with multi-vault ([e26b294](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/e26b294e8bbe1e49e44318152c247595e82639bb))\n- tree view and backlinks panel no longer appear when Dendron is not active (thank you [Christopher Corley](https://github.com/cscorley))\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- rename would fail if backlink existed at root note\n- numerous fixes to refactor hierarchy\n\n### House Cleaning\n\n- the `Dendron: Configure` command will now launch the config editor with the web ui\n- the old `Dendron: Configure` command as been renamed to `Dendron: Configure (yaml)`\n\n## 0.17.1\n\n### Features\n\n#### Automatic Hover's for Links\n\n- add hover provider ([8d19a1b](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/8d19a1b47f114ae738f7483fd751b62f68b46d24))\n\nYou can now preview notes and references inside the editor as a hover without ever opening the link.

Multi Vault lets you add additional [vaults](https://dendron.so/notes/c6fd6bc4-7f75-4cbb-8f34-f7b99bfe2d50.html#vaults-) to your Dendron workspace.\n\nEach vault is logically separate (they reside in separate directories) but can be universally queried using lookup.\n\nMulti vault enables a bunch of exciting use cases.\n\n![[dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.multi-vault#use-cases,1:#*]]\n\nCurrently, the following commands are supported with multi-vault:\n\n- Lookup \n- Deleting a Note\n- Navigating to a note using Tree View \n\nOther commands like rename/refactor will still work when performed in your primary vault. They will probably not work if performed against a note not inside your primary vault.\n\nWhen you use **Lookup** to create a new note with multi vault, the note will be created inside the same vault as the current opened note. **Lookup** will also show you the vault that each note belongs to while performing lookup.\n\nCurrently known issues (with supported commands):\n\n- unable to create a note using Lookup that has the same name as an existing note inside **any** of your vaults \n- unable to navigating to the root of a vault using Tree View\n\n#### Vault Add Command\n\nAdd a new vault to your workspace. \n\n<div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 62.5%; height: 0;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.loom.com/embed/b4171372f9794dd7be609c043f343fa3\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\"></iframe></div>\n\n#### Vault Remove Command\n\nRemove a vault from your workspace.

Features\n\n#### Really update time in frontmatter (server only)\n\nDendron notes have frontmatter with an **updated** field. This field is supposed to show you the time in milliseconds of when the document was last updated. Until today's update, this field did not actually change  😅\n\n```\nid: 65b03213-d3d1-46c0-9881-a6280ed9bdeb\ntitle: New\ndesc: ''\nupdated: 1602096212957\ncreated: 1602096212957\n```\n\nToday's update makes **updated** update! \n\n### Enhancements\n\n- **support BuildPod command (server mode)**: build pod now works when server mode is enabled\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- **navigating to special notes**: scratch/journal notes could fail to open if note already exists\n\n### Other\n\n![[dendron.topic.extensions#useful-extensions]]\n\n![[dendron.guides.tips#copy-and-paste-web-content-into-dendron:#*]]\n\n![[dendron.guides.cook#mobile-support:#*]]\n\n## [0.12.7](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/compare/v0.12.7-alpha.10...v0.12.7) (2020-10-13)\n\n### Features\n\n#### (Local) Server Side Indexing\n\nDendron can now index and manage your notes as a standalone **local** server independent from VSCode. \n\nThis is part of the [[server migration milestone|dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.server-migration]] which we took on for October. \n\nDendron's server side indexing is a **complete rewrite** of the [[Dendron engine|dendron.dev.design.engine]] which powers Dendron's lookup capabilities. The new engine is **leaner, meaner, and significantly faster** (especially when initializing your workspace with a large amount of notes).\n\nServer site indexing is a pre-cursor enables our upcoming roadmap items which include:\n\n- [[multi-vault support|dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.multi-vault]]\n- rich graphical interfaces for schemas, pods, and publishing\n- unified index for all dendron extensions (currently each extension makes a separate index of your notes and requires manual reloading)\n- realtime updates for graph extensions\n- custom dendron extensions written in any language \n\nServer side indexing is currently off by default since it's still a beta feature. You can turn it on by adding the following in your settings.\n\n```json\n\"dendron.useExperimentalLSPSupport\": true\n```\n\nNote that the current commands are currently un-available when you switch on on server side indexing:\n\n- RenameNote\n- Refactor Hierarchy\n- Archive Hierarchy\n- Realtime Schema Updates\n- Pod Commands\n\nYou can switch back to regular indexing at anytime by changing the above setting to `false` and running `> Developer: Reload Window`. \n\n### Enhancements\n\n- **Additional Arguments for lookup**: You can now use `noConfirm` and `value` arguments when creating custom lookup shortcuts ([docs](https://dendron.so/notes/a7c3a810-28c8-4b47-96a6-8156b1524af3.html#passing-arguments-to-lookup))\n- **Update Default Snippets**: default todo snippet now leaves a space after insertion\n- **Set custom log levels**: you can now define the verbosity of dendron logs using the `dendron.logLevel` configuration\n- **Upgraded Schema defaults** (server only): new schemas will be created using version one defaults\n- **Cleaner note frontmatter** (server only): new notes won't have the optional attributes in frontmatter\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- **Missing logs**: issue where `Open Logs` would not show logs\n- **Tree View empty**: tree view would not populate in some cases\n- **Upgrade Snippets with comments**: Upgrading settings would fail if they had comments inside the JSON\n\n### Breaking Changes\n\n- **Remove Scratch Note Command**: replaced by Lookup Scratch Note shortcut\n- **Remove Journal Note Command**: replaced by Lookup Journal Note shortcut\n\n### Progress\n\n#### Server Migration\n\nThese past two weeks have been spent on server migration work. We are almost at the end and I'm aiming to have full coverage of all existing functionality by early next week.\n\n![[dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.server-migration#tasks,1:#*]]\n\n### Other\n\n- Add overview of [[configuration|dendron.topic.config]]\n- Add proposal for [[custom color tabs|dendron.roadmap.project.n.backlog.color-tabs]]\n\n## [0.12.6](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/compare/v0.12.5...v0.12.6) (2020-10-07)\n\n### Features\n\n#### Default Snippets\n\nDendron now initializes your workspace with common default snippets\n\n![[dendron.topic.snippets#default-snippets,1:#*]]\n\n#### Latex Support on Published Site\n\n![[pkg.dendron-jekyll.topic.math#math,1:#*]]\n\n#### Introduce siteRepoDir Customization\n\n![[dendron.topic.publishing.configuration#siterepodir,1:#*]]\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- trying to publish the `dendron-template` no longer results in a missing links report\n- issue with schemas not showing up under lookup\n\n### Progress\n\nThis section tracks our progress against the milestones in our [[public roadmap|dendron.roadmap]]\n\n- [x] [[Seeds v0|dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.seeds]]\n- [ ] Server migration, progress: 70/100\n  ```\n  - below is a summary of our progress. we are currently about half way done\n  - aiming to have a workable version using the Dendron server by next week\n  ```\n  ![[dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.server-migration#tasks-1,1:#*]]\n\n### Other\n\n#### Seeds\n\n- We launched two [[seeds|dendron.topic.seeds]]. A seed is a dendron site that tries to be be a all encompassing reference for a particular vertical. Dendron provides specific libraries and CLIs that make it easy for users to create seeds from existing open source content as well as personal notes.\n\nCurrent Seeds:\n\n```\n- open PKM catalogue\n- open AWS catalogue\n```\n\n![[dendron.community.showcase#open-pkm-catalogue,1:#*]]\n\n![[dendron.community.showcase#Open-AWS-Catalogue,1:#*]]\n\n#### Alternatives\n\nthis announcement also comes with an ask.

You can get a feel for the new web client at https://wiki-next.dendron.so. \n\nSome features of note:\n- even though this is now a React app, all pages are still statically generated which means you still get full SEO benefits \n- after the first load, all links are pre-fetched and loaded client side which which results in instant page transitions :rocket:\n- the lookup for the web client uses the same lookup that exists in the desktop application\n- the web client is a vanilla nextjs app with some dendron defaults - this means you will be able to customize it like you would a regular nextjs/react app\n- the frontend for the web client re-uses the same code that we use internally for the web ui which means published pages will look near identical online and inside your workspace\n\nYou can find setup instructions [here](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/PgwAXFfotfgpFVqHQRlBl.html)\nDetails and rationale behind this change is [here](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/nB75cmdPhL7CTOATG6wpT.html)\n\nWe've created a github discussion thread for comments about the new web client [here](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/discussions/1145)\n\nIf you'd like to help us work on this, you can find an (incomplete) list of mvp milestone items [here](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/eQ5w4eqHrf4m1peq.html#mvp-milestones).

Hiding published anchors is the expected behavior (no config needed). \n- Dendron Markdown Links is now removed. \n\n### Ongoing \n<!-- Discuss ongoing efforts here -->\n\n- We're working on a fairly large CROP from a few cycles ago to add unlinked references ([#219](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/219)) and expect to complete this by next week. \n- We've come up with a new approach to default note creation in a multi-vault context. See the discussion [here](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/649)\n\n### Community\n\n#### Office Hours\n\nYou can find notes from our latest office hours [[here|dendron.community.office-hours.2021.07.11]] \n\n#### Thank You's\n\nA big **thanks** to the following gardeners that brought up issues, contributions, and fixes to this release :man_farmer: :woman_farmer: \n- [andrey-jef](https://github.com/andrey-jef) @evanAndiez#9559\n  - `+taxonomist`\n  - [Notes with ids starting with _ breaks publishing](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/945)\n  - [update config docs](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron-site/pull/137)\n- [Felipe Whitaker](https://github.com/felipewhitaker) Leite#5753\n  - `+taxonomist`\n  - [correct spelling](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron-site/pull/139)\n\nYou can see an overview of all roles [[here|dendron.community.roles]]\n\n### Changelog\n![[dendron.release.changelog#050,1:#049]]\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/16qtgkcY-tgiYZWafX9Sp.html","relUrl":"notes/16qtgkcY-tgiYZWafX9Sp.html"},{"doc":"Release Notes (version 0.49)","title":"Release Notes (version 0.49)","hpath":"dendron.release.2021-07-05","content":"\nDendron 0.49 has sprouted 🌱\n\n### Highlights\n\n-   **Native Dendron Preview.** Try out the brand new component with `Dendron: Show Preview v2`.

Use `Dendron: Launch Tutorial` to see for yourself.\n-   **Seed Bank Updates.** We continue to add seeds to the seed bank. See the announcement blog post [here](https://blog.dendron.so/notes/qTeL51LFD0Y8uC9ect7QV.html)\n-   **Enhancements, Stability and Performance.**\n    -   Graph Review readability\n    -   Easier pod development\n    -   Anchors/headers are now updated in real-time rather than on save.\n\n### Docs\n\nOur documentation changes a lot week by week.

We **do not and will never** read the data inside **your notes**.\n\nYou can see the full list of information we collect and why we do it in our [[telemetry documentation|dendron.ref.telemetry]] as well as instructions on how to opt out of telemetry.\n\nIf you have questions or concerns, please tell us in our #feedback channel or bring it up during office hours.\n\n### Office Hours\n\nWe are re-starting Dendron office hours! Office hours are a chance for the community to directly engage with the dendron team, ask questions, and give us feedback about how we're doing. We're still playing around with times and format but the first one will be this Sunday at 9:30AM Pacific time.

This iteration was mostly spent on our server migration as well as a series of quality of life improvements across Dendron's core features. You can find the details of all this in the highlights below. \n\n## Highlights\n\n- move to the final phase of the [[server migration|dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.server-migration]] \n  - Dendron server mode is now at feature parity with existing functionality \n  - the server migration is a complete re-write of Dendron's internal to go from a client to client (local) server model\n  - this is pre-requisite for a bunch of upcoming features like [[multi vault support|dendron.roadmap.project.n.2020.multi-vault]], rich graphical interfaces, and realtime graph updates\n  - server mode will be the default for all workspaces going forward\n  - existing workspaces will be transparently migrated over after next week\n- order of magnitude speed improvements (server mode only)\n  - initializing large vaults\n  - updating links through `Rename` and `Refactor` operations \n- better note references\n  - note references can now be nested \n  - a reference to a header can be made by selecting any part of the header before running `Copy Note Ref`\n- better timestamps (server mode only)\n  - the `updated` timestamp on notes now updates on every save\n  - timestamp will now print a human friendly label \n- improved publishing\n  - dendron sites now support latex\n  - dendron will generate a bad link report for all links that do not resolve when publishing\n  - bad links will now resolve to a custom 404 link\n  - you can define a custom site repository that will be used by publishing commands\n- consolidated lookup\n  - creating journal notes and scratch notes are now part of the `Lookup Command` instead of being separate commands (the old keyboard shortcuts still work - they now map to lookup commands with custom arguments)\n  - lookup now accepts arguments that can be passed in via custom keyboard shortcuts\n  - you can control the creation of special notes as well as note selection behavior from lookup\n\n## Seeds\n\nAside from features, we've also launched two [[seeds|dendron.topic.seeds]]. Seeds are **open source dendron sites** that **consolidate reference material** about a **particular vertical**. Content from the catalogues is derived from existing open source content as well as manual user input. Your 🙏 is welcomed and encouraged. \n\n![[dendron.community.showcase#open-pkm-catalogue,1:#*]]\n![[dendron.community.showcase#open-aws-catalogue,1:#*]]\n\n## Sustainability\n\nFinally, a bunch of you have asked if you can support Dendron financially. The answer is coming at the end of the month! Dendron will be coming out of **preview** in November, at which point we will launch our **Environmentalist Plan** 🌲. This is a monthly subscription to support the development of Dendron. **Environmentalist** will get a special badge on Discord, priority email/discord access to the development team, and stickers! More details on this soon.\n\n## Thank You\n\nLast and most of all, a big to the following gardeners that brought up issues, contributions, and fixes to this release.\n\n- [Britt](https://github.com/bs)\n  - [silent log errors](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/277)\n  - various doc updates \n- [onwijsbegeerte](https://github.com/onwijsbegeerte)\n  - [bad export pod placeholder text](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/270)\n- [agichim ](https://github.com/agichim)\n  - [checkbox in preview doesn't render correctly](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/269)\n- [Emaro](https://github.com/Emaro)\n  - [treeview empty in certain cases](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/263)\n- [robothor](https://github.com/robothor)\n  - [issue refactoring with mixed case filenames](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/250)\n\n\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/1b1aef8e-c9d5-42de-b850-d1b1467cf88b.html","relUrl":"notes/1b1aef8e-c9d5-42de-b850-d1b1467cf88b.html"},{"doc":"Release Notes(version 0.12)","title":"Release Notes(version 0.12)","hpath":"dendron.release.2020-09-20","content":"Dendron 0.12 is here 🌱\n\nThis week's focus was on publishing. We have a bunch of enhancements and additions to the publishing workflows. We also introduced the [[seeds library|dendron.topic.seeds]], a way of you to remix existing content with Dendron. You can see an example of this [here](http://aws.dendron.so/)\n\nThis release also brings some changes to Dendron's update cycle. \nYou might have noticed that Dendron updates rather aggressively 🚀🚀🚀\n\nOur current release cycle is a patch update every day and a minor release every week. \nMoving forward, we will be doing patch updates every few days and a minor release every two weeks. \n\nThe move to this new release cycle is a reflection that Dendron is growing rapidly and starting to mature. \n\nWe will be working on some major changes in October to stabilize the core feature set and make them easier to use. We will also be shifting our underlying architecture from a VSCode plugin to the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) which will result in a richer feature set and the ability for Dendron to be more easily integrated into additional editors.\n\nAs part of this update, we've put out the first version of the [Dendron principles](https://dendron.so//notes/7fcebd7d-6411-4c9d-8baf-65629dc018a1.html) which reflects our design philosophies and the direction we are taking Dendron. \n\nThis is a work in progress so feel free to make suggestions and comments in the discord.\n\nI've mentioned this before but we will also be releasing our formal roadmap by the end of the month. This roadmap will cover all major projects we plan on doing in 2020. \n\nWe are looking to come out of preview by the end of October and do a formal 1.0 release before the end of the year. \n\nI want to take this moment to again thank everyone for being part of our journey to build a better tool for managing knowledge 👨‍🌾👩‍🌾 \n\nI believe we're are planting something special here and am excited to see us grow 🌱 \n\nThese release notes are summary of the more notable changes, for the full list, please look at our [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)\n\n* * *\n\n## Cli\n\n### Support for seeds\n[[dendron.topic.seeds]]\n\n### Enhancements\n\n- Standardize on core cli flags across all commands\n- More options when planting seeds\n\n## Hierarchies\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Rename when stub is present \n\n## Lookup\n\n### Lookup new notes with Selection\n\n![[dendron.topic.lookup.create#creating-notes-with-a-selection,1]]\n\n### Enhancements\n\n- Lookup can extract highlighted text\n\n## Pods\n\n### Implement Json import pod\n\n![[dendron.topic.pod.builtin.json]]\n\n### Enhancements\n\n- All filepaths can be set relative to the workspace root\n- Json pod can import filenames as links\n- Standardize interface for import/export pod commands\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Handle stub notes correctly on import \n\n## Publishing\n\n### Publish command\n\n![[dendron.topic.commands#publish,1:#*]]\n\n### Copy note url command\n\n![[dendron.topic.commands#copy-note-url,1:#*]]\n\n### Enhancements\n\n- Support relative path for all file paths\n- Set custom path for publishing repo\n- Keyboard shortcuts for copy note url cmd\n- Be able to pass in custom args to commands\n- Support incremental page building\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Copy url truncates `//` \n\n## Thank You\n\nLast and most of all, a big **thanks** to the following gardeners that brought up issues, contributions, and fixes to this release.\n\n- [Denis Sikuler](https://github.com/gamtiq)\n  - update docs\n\n- [agichim](https://github.com/agichim)\n  - update docs\n\n- [Daria Vasyukova](https://github.com/gereleth)\n  - bug with copy note url\n\n- `Jack`\n  - issue with images on published sites\n\n- [Tom](https://github.com/peanutputter)\n  - [issue with image paths](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/200)\n\n- [Janne Ojanaho](https://github.com/jojanaho)\n  - [writeup on files vs folders](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/210)\n\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/8e59e25f-808c-42f1-a82a-e9ce4fd8edd8.html","relUrl":"notes/8e59e25f-808c-42f1-a82a-e9ce4fd8edd8.html"},{"doc":"Release Notes(version 0.11)","title":"Release Notes(version 0.11)","hpath":"dendron.release.2020-09-13","content":"![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/comic.1.png)\n\n- My wife, Ilana Lin, drew a comic for this week's release.

If publishing online isn't your jam, you'll be happy to know that you can now [export your notes](https://www.dendron.so/notes/66727a39-d0a7-449b-a10d-f6c438185d7f.html#json-pod) to any format you desire (as long as that format is JSON 😅 - more formats coming soon).\n\nIt's now been almost two months since Dendron first went into preview. Since launch, we've passed over a thousand downloads and closed over [100 issues](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) worth of features, enhancements, and bug fixes. \n\nIn that time, we've built an awesome community of Dendrites on Discord now numbering in the triple digits. I feel beyond grateful to everyone that has given Dendron a try in these early days 🌱 and become a part of our budding community. \n\nSpeaking of community, I would like to recognize two new **Dendrologist** - [Fayçal](https://github.com/d3vr) (@bsqrd#9701 ) and [Janne Ojanaho](https://github.com/jojanaho) (@jojanaho#3766 ) 👨‍🌾👩‍🌾\n\nDendrologists are active members of the Dendron community that will be helping me shape our roadmap, answer questions, and collect feedback from all of you.

Stay tuned for some big announcements later this week :) \n\nThese release notes are summary of the more notable changes, for the full list, please look at our [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)\n\n## Development\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Bad import causes dendron to not compile in case-sensitive file systems \n\n## Engine\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Fix bad sibling traversal cases \n- Issue with mixed case file names \n\n## Markdown\n\n### Support offset with note refs ([[docs|dendron.topic.references]])\n\nA note reference offset is a way to skip a number of lines when using a note reference. The syntax is `,{number}`. Below is an example of using a note reference offset to offset an initial heading, skipping the actual header when doing the embedding.\n\n- NOTE: currently, note reference offsets are limited to the first anchor inside a block reference. They must also be a positive value\n\n<a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/31cb62916586453f8475f94ba68b74a1\">  <img style=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/31cb62916586453f8475f94ba68b74a1-with-play.gif\"> </a>\n\n### Enhancements\n\n- Note refs will not be resolved when inside an inline code span or a fenced code block \n\n### Fixes\n\n- Fix issue with preview checkbox not updating markdown \n- Fix issue with backslash causing in certain markdown blocks \n\n## Pods\n\n### Support note references when Publishing Notes ([[docs|dendron.topic.publishing]])\n\nDendron has [[note references|dendron.topic.references]] that let you inline either the whole note or parts of a note into another note.

To that end, we introduced our own tree view, overhauled the getting started experience and created a cheatsheet of all commands (with GIFs of course). \n\nWe also took time to fix bugs and improve performance across Dendron's core features (eg. Lookup, Markdown Preview, etc). \n\nThese release notes are summary of the more notable changes, for the full list, please look at our [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)\n\n## Engine\n\n### Enhancements\n\n- Add check to make sure that lookup will throw an error if overwriting an existing file \n\n### Fixes\n\n- Sometimes lookup will not return all results on startup \n- Edge case where 'create new' was shown even when note exists \n- Having a naked date in frontmatter could cause lookup to fail \n\n## Hierarchies\n\n### Add Go Up Hierarchy command\n\nGo up to the closest non-stub parent of the currently open note.

[Kiran Pathakoda](https://github.com/kpathakota) has been one of the first to adopt Dendron as his primary note taking platform and will be helping out with the development of Dendron.\n\nIn practice, this means Kiran will be hanging around the discord, help triage issues, and help me put together a more comprehensive public roadmap for the project!\n\nIf you're interested in being more involved with the development of Dendron (and this doesn't have to involve coding), feel free to ping me on Discord or by email at [kevin@dendron.so](mailto:kevin@dendron.so).\n\nThere are a bunch of really exciting things that will be coming out over the next couple of weeks and we will need all the dendrologist we can get :) \n\n### New Channels\n\n- \\#dev: discuss all things related to Dendron development\n- \\#schemas: share and discuss schemas\n- \\#workflows: how do you take notes?\n\n## Thank You\n\nLast and most of all, a big **thanks** to the following gardeners that brought up issues and contributed fixes to this release.\n\n- [Jochen Burkhard](https://github.com/herop)\n- [Janne Ojanaho](https://github.com/jojanaho)\n- [Chris Na](https://github.com/buxel)\n- [Daria Vasyukova](https://github.com/gereleth)\n- [Denis Di Fazio](https://github.com/denisdifazio)\n- [nixsee](https://github.com/nixsee)\n\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/1a79e2a1-c906-4ed4-a528-15bd34c4e649.html","relUrl":"notes/1a79e2a1-c906-4ed4-a528-15bd34c4e649.html"},{"doc":"Release Notes(version 0.8)","title":"Release Notes(version 0.8)","hpath":"dendron.release.2020-08-23","content":"Schemas and pods were the focus of this week's efforts. \n\nSchemas are now both more powerful and re-usable with a custom `pattern` attribute as well as the ability to `import` existing schemas. As a bonus, you can also visualize your schemas using the `Show Schema Graph` command!\n\nOn the Pod site, we've made the process of publishing a pod more flexible with per hierarchical configuration options, a unified config syntax and automatic reloading of your config on every publish. \n\nThese release notes are summary of the more notable changes, for the full list, please look at our [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)\n\n## Bundled extensions\n\n### Add ShowSchema Command ([docs](http://dendron.so/notes/587e6d62-3c5b-49b0-aedc-02f62f0448e6.html#dendron-show-schema-graph))\n\nYou can now view your schemas using the same graph visualization as you do your notes!\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/graphs.show-schema.gif)\n\n### Enhancements\n\n- Dendron: reload graphs will reload both schema and note graphs \n- Dendron: reload graphs will reload both schema and note graphs \n- Dendron schema graph will show schemas by their title. if not set, revert to id. \n\n## Markdown\n\n### Enhancements\n\n- Markdown parsing can now be up to 300% faster publishing a site \n\n## Notes\n\n### Create Daily Journal Note Command ([docs](http://dendron.so/notes/5c213aa6-e4ba-49e8-85c5-1bdcb33ce202.html#daily-journal))\n\nThe daily journal helps you keep a journal for each day of the year. By default, it will create the journal under `daily.{date}` though this is configurable by setting the `dendron.dailyJournalDomain`.\n\nYou can create a daily journal using `> Dendron: Create Daily Journal Note` or `CMD+SHIFT+I` shortcut.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/notes.daily.gif)\n\n## Pods\n\n### Support different defaults on a per hierarchy basis when publishing ([[docs|dendron.topic.publishing.selective-publication]])\n\nYou can now set different publishing defaults for each hierarchy (as well as general defaults for your entire vault.)\n\nAs an example, below is the config for [my website](https://kevinslin.com). It publishes everything under the `home` and `blog` hierarchies but will only publish notes under `books` if `published: true` is set on the frontmatter. \n\n- `dendron.yml`\n\n```yml\nsite:\nsiteHierarchies: [home, blog, books]\nsiteRootDir: docs\nconfig:\n    books:\n    publishByDefault: false\n```\n\n### Implement new website config syntax ([[docs|dendron.topic.publishing.selective-publication]])\n\nNew config syntax unifies a bunch of different configuration options and renames others to more sensible names.\n\n### Enhancements\n\n- Auto migrate old-style site config to new style site config \n- Always read config before publishing. no more reloading the workspace after updating dendron.yml! \n- Update site config on dendron starter template \n- Use rsync to copy assets when building pods \n\n### Fixes\n\n- Use regular copy command if rsync not installed \n- Links not being converted to ids when publishing \n\n## Schemas\n\n### Support schema import ([docs](http://dendron.so/notes/c5e5adde-5459-409b-b34d-a0d75cbb1052.html#imports-optional-str))\n\nIt's now possible to import schemas! This means you can now create composable schemas from re-usable pieces.\n\nExample:\n\n- foo.schema. yml\n\n```yml\nversion: 1\nimports:\n- bar\nschemas:\n- id: foo\nparent: root\nchildren:\n    - bar.bar # notice that we prefix the id bar with the filename\n```\n\n- bar.schema.yml\n\n```yml\nversion: 1\nschemas:\n- id: bar\nparent: root\nchildren: \n    - one\n- id: one\n```\n\nThe above would match the following files\n\n```\nfoo.bar # match\nfoo.bar.one #match\n```\n\n### Support match by pattern ([[docs|dendron.topic.schema#pattern]])\n\nYou can now explicitly specify a glob pattern for any level of your schema. If not set, defaults to the schema `id`.\n\nThe following is an example of a schema for `journal` hierarchy. \n\n```yml\nschemas:\n- id: journal\ntitle: journal\ndesc: \"\"\nparent: root\nchildren:\n    - year\n- id: year\ntitle: year\npattern: \"[0-2][0-9][0-9][0-9]\"\nchildren: \n    - month\n- id: month\ntitle: month\npattern: \"[0-9][0-9]\"\nchildren: \n    - day\n- id: day\ntitle: day\npattern: \"[0-9][0-9]\"\nnamespace: true\n```\n\nThis will match the following queries\n\n```\n# journal\n# journal.2020\n# journal.2020.09\n# journal.2020.09.12\n# journal.2020.09.12.foo.md\n```\n\n### Enhancements\n\n- Set schema title to id if not set \n- Better error message on bad schema \n\n### Fixes\n\n- Autocomplete correctly on imported schema \n\n## Workspace\n\n### Fixes\n\n- A misconfigured POSIX path causes dendron to not load on windows \n\n## Thank You\n\nLast and most of all, a big **thanks** to the following gardeners that brought up issues and contributed fixes to this release.\n\n- [Devashish](https://github.com/ric03uec)\n- [Howard](https://github.com/runlevelrobot)\n- [komoda102](https://github.com/komoda102)\n\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/075e9806-0367-40a2-8154-2e84d5a1110.html","relUrl":"notes/075e9806-0367-40a2-8154-2e84d5a1110.html"},{"doc":"Release Notes(version 0.7)","title":"Release Notes(version 0.7)","hpath":"dendron.release.2020-08-16","content":"This is one of our biggest releases yet!

You can now customize every aspect of your `Journal` and `Scratch` notes - how they are added, their time format and even what they're called\n\n### Add Built in Snippets ([docs](https://www.dendron.so/notes/9eca1992-7540-4d9d-97fb-328b27748b2c.html))\n\nAll the one-liners and bad jokes that you have saved for that special someone? Type them out faster than ever with built-in snippets. This updates the default settings to allow tab-based snippet completion and also initialize new vaults with some default snippets. \n\n![snippets](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/tab-autocomplete.gif)\n\n### Enhancements\n\n- Copy on Create: Journal and Scratch notes will automatically copy their links to the clipboard after creation\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Scratch note title note being set properly \n- Not all notes indexed in sparse vaults: There was an issue where certain notes without a full hierarchy would not be indexed by Dendron. That issue has now been eliminated.\n- Notes created via link not being indexed properly: Issue where sometimes new notes created using link navigation wasn't being indexed. \n\n## Pods\n\n### Custom Blogging Layout ([docs](https://www.dendron.so/notes/4c0ef322-3006-405c-9a66-3134dd9649a5.html#blogging))\n\nSometimes you have something you just need to shout out from the rooftops. Because its likely people think that you are a crazy person if you did this, Dendron now has dedicated blogging layouts so you can blog instead! \n\n### Fixes\n\n- Issue with buildpod logging \n\n## Schemas\n\n### Apply Schema Description to New Notes ([docs](https://www.dendron.so/notes/c5e5adde-5459-409b-b34d-a0d75cbb1052.html#desc))\n\nSchemas now automatically apply their description to newly created notes that match said schema. Because life is too short to annotate all your notes all the time. \n\n### Enhancements\n\n- Remove data field from new schemas: Schema notes only show you fields that are required on creation. \n\n## Workspace\n\n### Enhancements\n\n- Update index when notes are deleted outside of dendron: We know that sometimes, it can't be helped and you'll need to work with your notes outside of Dendron. If that work is deleting notes, Dendron will now keep track of it and remove it from its lookup index as well!\n\n## Other\n\n### Make Dendron available on [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/) ([docs](https://dendron.so/notes/9134f160-31a6-4ab0-a640-1fce466f9526.html#open-vsx))\n\nMaybe you just don't like Microsoft. Maybe you want to see other people. Whatever the reason, Dendron is now available on all VSCode compatible editors like [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) and [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/).\n\n## Thank You\n\nLast and most of all, a big **thanks** to all these people that contributed issues and suggestions during this release.\n\n- [Josh Finken](https://github.com/jfinken)\n- [denisdifazio](https://github.com/denisdifazio)\n- Annegrim\n- [Chris Na](https://github.com/buxel)\n\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/075e9806-0367-40a2-8154-2e84d5a020e2.html","relUrl":"notes/075e9806-0367-40a2-8154-2e84d5a020e2.html"},{"doc":"Release Notes(version 0.5)","title":"Release Notes(version 0.5)","hpath":"dendron.release.2020-08-02","content":"With the coming of August, 2020 is officially on the wane.

Happy gardening! 🌱\n\nWith this release, we are also conducting our first dendron user survey. It's a short survey that should take no more than 3 minutes to fill out and will help inform me on the future growth of Dendron. Your participation is immensely appreciated 🙏\n\n<https://forms.gle/PPqe2axvwEmpXj4v5>\n\nThese release notes are summary of the more notable changes, for the full list, please look at our [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)\n\n## Legend\n\n- 🚧 experimental feature\n\n## Commands\n\nDendron has a series of built-in commands. They are all prefixed with `Dendron:` and can be accessed through the [[command prompt|dendron.concepts#command-palette]].\n\n### Add Doctor Command\n\n([d4fa71c](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/d4fa71cd839782587d47a3ba1b0f7e89742e7ffe)) ([[docs|dendron.topic.commands#doctor]])\n\nThis makes sure your workspace is up to date. It will execute the following actions:\n\n- add ids and titles to the frontmatter of all notes that are missing it\n- setup a `docs` folder if it doesn't exist. Required if you want to [[publish|dendron.topic.publishing]] your notes\n\n<a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/bd045f708f8e474193de8e3de0dc820f\"> \n<img style=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/bd045f708f8e474193de8e3de0dc820f-with-play.gif\"> \n</a>\n\n### Add ShowHelp Command\n\n([ecf3c68](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/ecf3c6822848834d9a00e373d1c59b6628e7f4df))([[docs|dendron.topic.commands#show-help]])\n\nDendron will open your current browser to the [[quickstart|dendron.tutorial.recap]] page. \n\n<a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/b81ce02f30b84d79b92584f339184a00\">\n<img style=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/b81ce02f30b84d79b92584f339184a00-with-play.gif\"> \n</a>\n\n## Pods\n\nPods are the mechanisms Dendron uses to import and export notes. Dendron has a different pod depending on where you are getting and publishing your data to. \n\n### 🚧 Support Publishing Notes\n\n([e063732](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/e063732d1ff082dd8520a479926e7ceb1b0893ab)) ([[docs|pkg.dendron-publishing]])\n\nDendron lets you publish the contents of your vault, either in its entirety or only a subset. Notes are published under the [dendron-jekyll theme](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron-jekyll). \n\n### Features\n\n#### Nested Hierarchies\n\ndendron-Jekyll supports the same nested hierarchies as your notes and allows you to navigate via the sidebar.\n\n<img style=\"max-width: 720px;\" src=\"https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/site-hierarchy.gif\" />\n\n#### Lookup\n\nIf you'd rather not click, dendron-Jekyll also supports path-based lookup.\n\n<img style=\"max-width: 720px;\" src=\"https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/site-lookup.gif\" />\n\n#### Permanent Ids\n\nEvery page is published using its unique ID which means that URLs will never change, even if the filenames do.\n\n<img style=\"max-width: 720px;\" src=\"https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/site-ids.jpg\" />\n\n#### Free hosting, custom domain names and SSL Certs\n\nIf you have a free GitHub account, then you can host your Dendron notes for free using [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) \n\n<img style=\"max-width: 720px;\" src=\"https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/site-domain.jpg\" />\n\n#### Jekyll Liquid Tags and Variables\n\n- NOTE: this will only be \"compiled\" in the published site but won't be rendered in the regular markdown \n\n<img style=\"max-width: 720px;\" src=\"https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/site-liquid.gif\" />\n\n#### Selective Publication\n\nYou can choose to publish your whole vault or a single domain within your vault. \n\n- NOTE: It is not currently possible to publish multiple domains. If you would like this feature, you can vote for it [here](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/64).\n\n### Setup initial workspace to be ready for publishing\n\n([e1242b4](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/e1242b494cc91b3284053b54dccecc4e4686ab7d))\n\nAll workspaces created from Dendron `0.5` onwards will have all the necessary configuration pre-loaded for publishing. \n\n## Schemas\n\nThink of schemas as an **optional type system** for your notes. They describe the hierarchy of your data and are themselves, represented as a hierarchy.\n\n### Enable lookup for Schemas\n\n([19b4677](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/19b46770fe6a842831692563de96ff4a823df871)) ([docs](https://www.dendron.so/notes/a7c3a810-28c8-4b47-96a6-8156b1524af3.html#schemas))\n\nThe process for finding schemas using Dendron is the same as that for finding notes. One lookup to rule them all. \n\nFind Schema\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/schema-lookup.gif)\n\nCreate Schema\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/schema-create.gif)\n\nDelete Schema\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/schema-delete.gif)\n\n### Schema Templates\n\n([0205d66](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/0205d66fc4538361322ffeabb3e532f0d541b775)) ([docs](https://www.dendron.so/notes/c5e5adde-5459-409b-b34d-a0d75cbb1052.html#schema-templates))\n\nSchema templates let you specify a pre-defined template that will automatically be applied to all notes that match the template. You can see a video of how this works below.\n\nThis is extremely useful whenever you want to re-use the outline of a note. Examples include daily journals, weekly shopping lists, and weekly reviews.  \n\n<a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/481b7ab051394c1caa383383bd265755\"> \n<img style=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/481b7ab051394c1caa383383bd265755-with-play.gif\"> \n</a>\n\n### Simpler Schema Syntax\n\n([d53ddb](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/d53ddb73bfacc3f769db88cfd4f482a706dcb6dd))\n\nSchema syntax has been simplified. Before we had an extra `data` field to namespace the `namespace` field. We flattened all schema attributes to make the syntax more elegant. Note that the old styled `data` syntax is still supported but we recommend moving to the new syntax as `data` will be deprecated in a few releases.\n\n## Fixes\n\nBugfixes for this release\n\n- Fix issue with Journal Names on Windows ([d0bfe7f](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/d0bfe7fb0288e8610fc4b177ee85697a8ebc3efe))\n- Stub nodes should keep parents when deleted ([f32f291](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/f32f291bc7a1ddd6c542483730e2db74b400dafa))\n- Issue with Urls in published site ([0ac8e75](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/0ac8e75c95a9c4760e12bb301fc5b66b011ef0fb))\n\n## Enhancements\n\n- CI/CD testing ([d6ce68c](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/d6ce68c720d7e8c96d7f4bb6ab390c1bd52c5218))\n  - Dendron now has continuous integration tests for all pushes. ![](https://travis-ci.com/dendronhq/dendron.svg?branch=master)\n  - Tests run on mac, linux and windows which means moving forward, there should be fewer OS (aka Windows) related issues \n- Update quickstart docs to showcase new features ([aec0fe0](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/commit/aec0fe0939239d84f5b7ebd9ebae57a09bcdae43))\n\n## Next\n\nA teaser of some items we are working on for the next release.

It's set when you first run `Dendron: Initialize Workspace`. The folder that contains your workspace is also known as your **workspace root**.\n\nA workspace has a `dendron.yml` file that specifies its [[vaults|dendron.topic.vaults]].\n\n## Commands\n\n### Workspace: Add and Commit\n\nAdd and commit all notes across all vaults to git.\n\n### Workspace: Sync\n\nSynchronizes all notes across all vaults with git. Any changes you made will be pushed back to remote, and any changes in the remote will be pulled.\n\nIn more detail: Dendron will first commit all your changes, then pull changes from the remote, and finally push everything back to the remote. This workflow is good in most cases: private notes, internal shared vaults, or your personal writings. This workflow doesn't work as well in some cases however, so we offer per-vault configuration options which you can use to adjust how your notes are synchronized.\n\nYou can set these configuration options in your `dendron.yml`, either for each vault with the `sync` option, or for all [[workspace vaults|dendron.topic.vaults#workspace-vault]] with the `workspaceVaultSync` option. The configuration will look like this:\n\n```yml\n... rest of your dendron.yml\nworkspaceVaultSync: noPush\nvaults:\n    -\n        fsPath: my-website\n        sync: noCommit\n        remote:\n            type: git\n            url: 'git@github.com:my-username/my-website.git'\n    -\n        fsPath: my-notes\n        sync: sync\n        type: git\n            url: 'git@github.com:my-username/my-notes.git'\n```\n\n#### configuration options\n\n##### sync\n\nDendron will try to synchronize everything: Dendron will first commit all your changes, then pull changes from the remote, and finally push everything back to the remote. This is the default for regular vaults.\n\n##### noCommit\n\nPull and push updates if the workspace is clean, but don't commit. You manually commit your local changes, but automatically share them once you committed. This is good for vaults where you want to write a meaningful commit message and control what is being committed, for example a shared knowledge base or wiki. This is the default for [[Workspace Vaults|dendron.topic.vaults#workspace-vault]].\n\n##### noPush\n\nCommit any changes and pull updates, but don't push. You can watch the repository and make local changes without sharing them back. This is good if you want to watch the updates in a vault and maybe even note your own thoughts in the vault without sharing them, for example an organization handbook that you don't want to edit yourself.\n\n##### skip\n\nDon't do any synchronization. This may be useful if you use some other tool to synchronize this vault.\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/c4cf5519-f7c2-4a23-b93b-1c9a02880f6b.html","relUrl":"notes/c4cf5519-f7c2-4a23-b93b-1c9a02880f6b.html"},{"doc":"Web UI","title":"Web UI","hpath":"dendron.ref.web-ui","content":"\n## Summary\n- status: [[Experimental 🧪|dendron.ref.status#experimental-🧪]]\n\nThe Dendron Web UI refers to Dendron's native UI components build using the latest web technologies (instead of VSCode components).\nThis lets us create dynamic interfaces with dynamic dropdowns, drag and drop and custom made components. \n\n## Quickstart\n\nTo get started, set [[enableWebUI|dendron.topic.config.dendron#enablewebui]] to true and then reload your workspace to enable.\n\n## Components\n\n### TreeView\n\nThis is an implementation of the [[Dendron Tree View|dendron.topic.workbench#dendron-tree-view]] using the Dendron Web UI. \n\n#### Nav Order\nThe nav order should be implemented in the following precedent:\n- Alphanumeric\n\n### Calendar View\n\nThe Dendron Calendar View lets you view your daily journal in calendar form.\n\n<!-- TODO: picture -->\nThe Dendron Calendar View has the following capabilities:\n\n- Clicking on a given day date will open the corresponding daily journal note\n- Clicking on a given day without a daily journal note will create one\n- Days without daily journal note are grayed out and days that contain an entry are displayed in white.\n- Shows indicators in the form of dots (max 5) to reflect the word count of that entry.

And have you had a chance to play around with engine at all, or this is the first time.\n\n0:07  \nUm, I've opened it and read a little bit of the doc in it. And that's all I've done.\n\n0:13  \nOkay, cool. That's perfect. And so right now,\n\n0:17  \nwhen you turned up in the, in the, in the couple of discord threads was really the first point that I looked at it at all, and I haven't spent much time looking. And then you throw this out, like, Okay, this jumpstart.\n\n0:33  \nCool. Yeah. And that's kind of what this onboarding is for. It's, it's, you know, today's help, even if you haven't even opened it up just to give you the idea of, you know, why you might want to. And so right now, what you're looking at is identity and workspace, and the way so let's back up and tension. We manage your notes and our work states and if you use VS code, it's the equivalent of the VS code workspace. So that's a one to one match in there. And the way that you start off is you can initialize the workspace. And right now, I did me, we can just make a new one, like lead you. And so this is saying the workspace should be at this location. And so when we create a workspace, we can either create one with intention tutorial notes, and that has right or you can do an empty one. So I'm just going to do an empty one in this case. And so when you create an empty workspace, you have one file, which is the root file. And this is just there for this is kind of like your phone. And the way that denture and works is if you want to create a file, you can just type command L. I'm going to toggle screencast mode, command l triggers to look up bar, and most of the things you'll do in engine will involve this one have you used tools like Notational Velocity no So Notational Velocity, it's it was a tool where basically when you are looking for a file, for example, if I type Python, if the file doesn't exist, then it creates it for you. If it does, if that if it does exist, it will fetch it. So it's this idea that you never really have to think about\n\n2:22  \nthe accessing your data.\n\n2:26  \nAnd\n\n2:27  \nso I'm assuming that dendron is putting the is that a YAML? header?\n\n2:33  \nYes, that is a yamo header.\n\n2:35  \nSo it's just automatically doing that when it creates the file.\n\n2:39  \nExactly.\n\n2:41  \nAnd for the yamo header, the idea here is we store some metadata. So every node has a unique ID. And the reason we do that is because if you choose to you can publish your notes. That's my local version that this is the engine website is actually a published vault.\n\n2:59  \nAh, Why. So I created a\n\n3:03  \nworkspace with the with the help notes. Yeah. So that's why it looks the same.\n\n3:10  \nYep, exactly. And it is generated from the notes. And the reason and if you notice the IDs for each note, when you publish the notes are actually published by their ID not by the name. And what's nice about that is even if you've renamed the notes, as long as you keep the frontmatter, it will show publish to the same URL.\n\n3:29  \nInteresting,\n\n3:30  \nokay. And, okay, so, and as I'm battling off, if at any point, you want to just like stop me and say, like, hey, like, what's this? What would you guess? Do you just feel free to I tend to otherwise just keep talking?\n\n3:42  \nOh, no, that's fine. That's exactly what I was hoping. Okay,\n\n3:45  \nokay. Um, so creating, so as far as creating notes, you can type it. If it exists, it'll fetch it. If it doesn't then it it will create a another way of creating notes as using wiki links, which is double bracket syntax. So for example, if I wanted to go to Ruby, I could type in Ruby. And then if you do the go to definition shortcut, then you can go to default on Mac is something different. I just changed it to Ctrl, enter. So if I do Ctrl, enter, I can go into Ruby, sometimes some markdown preview, well, like, not update right away. But in, for example, in groovy, I can type in Python, and I can go here and I can go back to Python. And making these links, it's kind of the same thing as look up in like JavaScript, for example, JavaScript doesn't exist. But if I navigate to it, then venturing well creatively.\n\n4:42  \nThat's kind of the same way obsidian works.\n\n4:47  \nAnd it's just this idea that you shouldn't be thinking about the order of files. It's, you know, not likely and notetaking should just be the information that you're working with. And as far as bi directional linking On the left hand panel, so we have a backlink section. And the backlinks section shows you all the notes that this note is linked by. And so in Python, it's showing you that hey, Ruby links do Python. Yep. And I think obsidian has a similar panel, but it's, yeah, it's a backlink panel. Now, the thing that Oh, and I guess one more thing before I get into hierarchies, we support let's see, this is header one.\n\n5:35  \nThis is header Two,\n\n5:39  \none.\n\n5:43  \nSo denisha. We also support what we call defences, loan costs and block graph. I think loan costs and block references. We call them nodes references. I think obsidian also has a doe I'm not sure what they call it.\n\n5:58  \nI don't actually have this Same. There are references to headers and things, but they don't. It's a little different.\n\n6:07  \nRight? So what I'm going to show you is in dendron, you can embed notes and other notes. So for example, I just hit Command Shift R, which copy the left lens of this note, and the, and then I can paste it, for example in JavaScript. And so I'm seeing the Python notes embedded in the JavaScript note. You can either choose to reference a note, or you can choose to reference a header. So for example, everything starting from heading one, and you can also do games. So you can say everything starting from header one to header two, that you can embed notes into other nodes. And then the other thing that you can do is you if you keep bullets, the markdown preview is mutable in the sense that you can click on the lead and also update the markdown. Yes, that's a little thing that I find people get quite excited about that\n\n7:08  \nover if you're going to use to do if you're going to use those\n\n7:10  \nas to dues it's a big deal. Exactly. Um, okay, and now getting to the part. So right now what I've shown you it's pretty similar to obsidian it's pretty similar to go more like how normal note taking apps work. The things that dungeon the dungeon now starts doing differently is we're focused on having your notes conform to some sort of structure. And so that's not to say like, as you can see, like we support backlinks so you can link any note to any note. But the problem that I found and the reason why I made my own note taking tool is I find that once you get a lot of notes, you need some sort of structure, if you organize it, if it's all backlinks, like it becomes really hard to find something, whether it's a naming convention, whether it's some sort of hierarchy, like there need to be some sort of structure to help you find it. And so in Benjamin, for us that structure is hierarchy. So the way that you create a hierarchy, and Benjamin is whatever. So when you do command L, you the lookup bar gets populated by the current note that you're in. And so if you have not, then you're creating a new level in the hierarchy. So for example, I can do Python data. And so you know, this is a data node. But the hierarchy is, Python is parents data as a child. And under data, for example, I might want to do if I'm learning about Python, data could be you know, all of the various data structures that Okay, my path and setting I can look in billions and things. And the nice thing about this hierarchy is now instead of, you know, you manually having to link all the nodes together, because you are in the Python hierarchy, you can you have a bird's eye view of everything in this hierarchy.\n\n8:59  \nThat's just kind of Gaining\n\n9:02  \ninterest. Another way you can see the hierarchy is we have to show graph command. And so just like how obsidian has a graph, Python, now Python engine has a graph. But this is a graph with backlinks. It's a graph of your hierarchy. And so, you know, as you note, like there isn't a connection between Ruby and Python, even though there's a backlink, what this is showing you, you can think of it as a top down view of your table of contents of the hierarchies that you have. Right. Now, the nice thing about having this is like right now, for example, Python this in stone thing, that web engine lets you do, so let me back up for a moment. hierarchies, I find are one of the best ways of organizing notes by most people and most tools don't really support it as well. And that's because I think not because hacky some work, but because he had no tooling on our piece. Like if you had your files in a folder Actually, you could put them in a bunch of different folders, but then like finding them is more difficult. And then if you ever wanted to rename anything, that's just a nightmare. And so attention, we're building on this idea that it is actually some of the most effective ways of managing information with people. And we it's built around this idea that as hope you work with hierarchies, and one thing we let you view is we let you be factor. So for example, right now, I'm under a Python. But let's say that I shut off a entering text I want to replace. So I'm saying for Python instead of Python. Oops, let me again, instead of Python, go place Python with Lang Python. And what this is going to do is everywhere where you have python.md, it's going to add the Lang prefix for programming language. And if I hit proceed, proceed. What you'll notice is that not only did all the falaschi name but also If I go, for example, into movie, all the links to the palace, and also then. And so it's just an easier way of managing the hierarchies. And now, like, why might you want to do this? Well, because I have this just crazy thing. So because I have this programming language it, what it lets me do. And this is really what I started doing with my notes is, if I'm learning, for example, a programming language, and I'm working on like two or three at a time, it's really difficult to context switch between them. It's like, how do we do this in Ruby, how you listen to Python? What I found was much more conducive is if I could think like, okay, in a programming, what is my model for programming language. And so for example, a programming language has data structures, and so I could apply that to Ruby as well. So for example, for Ruby, it also has data structures. And then what I could do is when I'm learning about Ruby, you know, I could translate that higher He that I learned from Python, and put it into a movie. And what this lets me do now is, now it's a lot easier to context switch between different programming languages, because I'm thinking more about the concepts than the actual implementation. And for example, now, if I'm like in my hierarchy for So first of all, like, if I'm looking at data structures in Python, I have all of them in one view. But now let's say that I want to look up data structures for all my programming languages, then I also have a similar view for that. And so now, this idea, and this is where it really, for me, like, became like, the way that I did all my notes is having these hierarchies not only are they a great organizational scheme, because now instead of having 100, you know, 1000 notes at the top level, you only have, you know, the very good stuff behind this. So it's programming languages. It's cooking as you know. Few things that you care about at the top level, and you can drill down into them. And when you drill down into them, it's not just organizational. It's something that, for me, at least, it helps me learn about the topic. Because I find the heipiess that I create, for, you know, a programming language or anything, they affect my mental model of it. And I find over time, when I'm learning about things, it's not actually the implementation that matters, but it's the fact that I've been able to develop this hierarchy and then continue refining it over time.\n\n13:34  \nThat makes sense. Well, there's nothing that keeps you from just having a bunch of loose notes at some, somewhere even if, even if it's nothing. If for the sake of cleanliness, you you create a hierarchy starting with Miss and stuff under it. You have the same thing you have typically totally get the language thing. I once had a situation where I had the word two computer assembly languages. Yeah. And one of them had right to left operation on the instructions. And the other had left to right, but three quarters and now, three quarters of the names of operations were the same. So you just had to remember whether you were in left, right or right, left. So yeah, I totally get that.\n\n14:28  \nAnd the other thing that I do for these notes, and let me just going to show you this is my one of my vaults. This is a notes for a meeting today. But for example, I have a CI and this is like all the CI commands that I run into, and it's not just necessary. Oh, okay. So that one. It's like, if I run into a problem instead of, you know, googling it,\n\n14:55  \nyeah.\n\n14:56  \nI don't know how half a cache of it. So if I run into the same problem, they And, you know, I can just go into that COI hierarchy.\n\n15:04  \nAnd right because it's the one, it's the one. I did that last month. I know I know that, but I don't remember.\n\n15:12  \nExactly. And if you look at this, I think I have a couple of hundred different commands. And the nice thing about this as like, I did none of this, you know, ahead of time, it was kind of a just in time, I ran into cognitive work. I needed to Stack Overflow, it took me 10 minutes. I never want to spend time on it again. Let me go into, you know, yeah.\n\n15:36  \nOkay, cool.\n\n15:38  \nSo, can we look a little bit at, um, kind of your to dues?\n\n15:44  \nYeah. So, two dues let me actually, okay, I'm going to do two things. I'm first going to show you how you would create it from scratch and then I'll show you my two dues for the day. I like to organize things by projects. And so I usually have like a project hierarchy. Actually. And so for example, one project might be different. And so under dendron, what I actually do is I have a daily journal that I go over everything I need to do for that particular day. And let me think, what is the best way of showcasing, I'm just going to show you my to do actually.\n\n16:28  \nSo this is my to do for a dendron.\n\n16:32  \nAnd let me show you and the video. And what I do is intention, you have this notion of your journal notes. And so journal notes is basically whatever hierarchy you're currently in, and appends journal to it in the current date. And this is configurable. You can change the date format, you can change how it appends it, but I'm going to move on to tomorrow's date. And the way you do that is Ctrl Shift J. But you can use that to create a new Going on it. And then what I do is every day, are you familiar with snippets inside VS code?\n\n17:07  \nOh, I haven't used them inside VS code. I use external snippet code.\n\n17:14  \nWell, I, anyways, I use a bunch of snippets. And so apprehension journal snippet, and that will fill it out with\n\n17:21  \nOkay, might get the idea even though I haven't used it.\n\n17:25  \nYeah. And then the way I do two dues that's worked really well. For me, if I'm just working by myself, I have a snippet to make this bullet. And then I'll write you know, task one, task two tasks week.\n\n17:38  \nSomething that\n\n17:40  \ndension does fairly well is for example, sometimes like past one, it turns out to be a much bigger task and has a notion of sketch notes. And so let me and so this is all just special cases, it's you can create a sketch note by Command Shift s, and you can choose to add a title or not. If you don't add a title by default. It creates under your current high hierarchy denture and dots batch, and then the current date and timestamp. And you can think of this cache notice as caches, it's just, oh, I'm in a meeting, I need to take a note, I don't want to figure out where I'm gonna move it. So I'm just going to start you know, taking. And so that's kind of the purpose of discussion. And then later on, you can like rename it, and then follow it away somewhere if you want to. The more interesting thing is, if I highlight tasks, for example, and then I do the shortcut for a sketch note, what it does, is it creates a link from this task to the sketch note. And so now, you know, I can use this to create nested tasks. So you know, task 1.1 1.2 and if I find that, you know, task 1.1 is still too big, and I need to break it down even further. I can create another cash flow from that and then you know, create even more tasks. So you can go as deep as you want to that I usually find that to be To TCP level sign up yeah\n\n19:04  \nthat deeper probably needs to be broken up\n\n19:08  \nand but what's really cool about this is you can start off with a bullet and you can still keep this nicely bulleted list but then you can you know, expand upon it as much as you need to. Um, but as far as like project management goes the way I manage projects is I have my daily to dues and then I look at my to dues from the previous day. And then like anything I haven't done the previous day, I will copy it over into today. And then I will I use a bullet journal format so like I will add like a lesson sign.\n\n19:47  \nGo No, I don't use it, but I'm familiar with it.\n\n19:51  \nAnd something else that you can do is this is VS code feature more than attention feature better And then most people don't know about this. If you notice, for example, I have tags to some of my tasks, what I can do VS code has a search editor feature where you can search within your current note. And so if I type in start, it shows me For example, all my lines were have to start counting. And what's cool about this is this search is globbing. And so what I can do is by I have this shortcut set up, that brings me a search of whatever the current notice, but I can, for example, go here to show me Okay, what are all my past titled start within this month? And this shows me all of that materialized in a single view. All right, go What is everything, you know, in this year, or, you know, it's a quote skyjack so you can get as fancy as you like, and what what I will say this like this search, edit I view it's a VS code thing, not an engine thing, but it's Because the engine, if you follow dingemans method of putting stuff in hierarchies, it makes us search things super powerful, because now you can glob and search within. Yeah, the big dates. You can, for example, if you think back to a programming example, in Python, you can search, you know, under Python, everything in Python that has a gotcha tag, or everything in programming languages, that was hard. And that is something that you get for free with the hierarchy. This is nicely structured, being able to just search everything within that.\n\n21:38  \nSo what's really fascinating about this for me to watch, is that the name that you get, which is the hierarchy with with dots as separators on the mainframe, that's actually how hierarchical folder structures are achieved. Yeah,\n\n22:01  \nthat exact naming convention.\n\n22:04  \nNice. I haven't had the pleasure of using many mainframes in the days.\n\n22:09  \nYeah, so that was that one harks back, like decades for me. Okay.\n\n22:14  \nUm, so I have an unrelated question, what is the tool you're using? That's echoing the keystrokes. And that's actually VS code. So VS code has something called screencast mode. I'll go ahead, it will show you all the keystrokes.\n\n22:29  \nCool. All right.\n\n22:31  \nAnd that's a nice thing about building engine inside VS code is that, for me, like what was different about attention and what the thing I'm trying to promote is this idea of keeping your notes in a hierarchy and giving you the tools to work with that hierarchy. But then all the other stuff, for example, like being able to work with markdown and supporting multiple panes and having all the other stuff that you need in an editor. It's not really differentiating and you codecademy is a great place for that. And plus you have all the extensions. And VS code has and VS code has like a lot of new features. One of them another one that I really like that I find most people don't know about is you can toggle lines. So if you do option, arrow key, you can move lines up and down. And I find that really nice for prioritizing because I usually like to, you know, keep stuff in this sort of format. And this way, I can easily move stuff down when I'm done. And what's cool is it's not just a single line, you can highlight a whole block and you can move that whole block at a time. But it's just another one little known feature that I find it makes a big quality of life. Yeah.\n\n23:48  \nLet's see.\n\n23:51  \nUm, this. That's the other thing that you can do. indention is you can paste images. I find that's a question I get a lot specially with Mark And so I use a program called sketch, which lets me take a screenshot of the screen. And then if I do Command Shift C, it puts that image into my clipboard. And then inside address, you can kinda paste image command, which will take whatever is in your clipboard, put it in this path in the vault. And then now you have the picture. And I find that useful because I in markdown paste ads at night, adding media is usually like a problem that people have.\n\n24:32  \nYeah, obsidian handles that pretty well, much the same way. So yeah, that one I haven't had a lot of friction on.\n\n24:41  \nAnd\n\n24:42  \nthat's really interesting.\n\n24:45  \nYeah, the hierarchy is definitely the thing that I am working upon. And oh, one thing I haven't shown you and this is more of an advanced feature, but you can create schemas for your hierarchies and you can think of femurs is kind of being able to type check. And so I'll show you what I mean by that. So right now I'm creating a lens. And the way I go to schema is I do Command Shift L. And this shows me all the schemas that I have. So it's kind of lookup, but instead of looking for markdown files, I'll explore YAML files. And so your schema, it is just a yamo. And it follows. And what it does, so is it says that, okay, there is a node that is named. And so Lang is the root of your hierarchy. And you can, for example, say that this has children. So for example, Python, it's Ruby. And the only thing you need to specify for the children is that they exist. And now you need to reload the index between schema changes because it hasn't picked up on Live, that's going to change later. But now, if I go into my lookup, if I type in Lang, for example, you'll notice it's actually a little book to it. And the little book over here means that hey, Lang is part of the schema. And if I go down, I can see that Oh, like there's a little book next to Python. That's part of the schema. If you look at JavaScript, because I created\n\n26:31  \nit. It's not in the schema, if you look at Java, this little question mark, because it's not in the schema. And the reason you might want to do this is for example, like as I'm building my hierarchy, oh, one thing is you don't have to like enumerate everything. So this a namespace property where you can say this is a namespace. And so now, this is essentially saying that this is going to match now Not start the globbing pattern. The scheme is just based off this simple globbing pattern\n\n27:06  \nthat would pick up if it existed.\n\n27:08  \nYeah. And so now if I go to Java, this little book to it, because that's in a sec, okay, I recognize it. Now, the interesting part here is now for my children, for example, if I say data,\n\n27:21  \nso data structures,\n\n27:24  \nand you know, and data, let's say that as their children, like, spring, I have a lot of different autocompletes. So that Well, sometimes,\n\n27:38  \nyeah, no, I know how that works. I get that a lot. Yeah.\n\n27:43  \nSo let's say that I crave\n\n27:46  \nthat. And so this schema of the way that the globbing patterns work is the children will inherit the parents as a prefix. So this will match Lang dot star dot data. And then string will match Lang dot star dot data watchman. But the schema is also hierarchal. And so now, if I reload my index, if I go to lang.db, dot away, for example, there's a book, because it's part of my schema. But if I look into your data, that Boolean does nothing, because it's not part of my schema. And schemas are really lightweight. It's just that yamo and we don't stop you from creating things outside of your schema, we just show you a question mark. But it's nice. For example, if you're building a programming language hierarchy, and just like sometimes use Google, sometimes use Boolean and you want to keep it consistent, you can document it in your schema. And the engine will also tell you when you're going outside of it, and in the future, we'll add options if you want you to actually enforce it. So you can say like, hey, like, actually don't have any great things that go outside of this. Okay? And that's just because like if my this is how likely entropy builds up and up looks like you name one thing for one fee and then another one for another, and then you have a million different things.\n\n29:07  \nYep, I have, I have several backlinks that I have to go clean up because I did somebody's name or title or something differently in two different places.\n\n29:20  \nl and schema strike now. We are also this going to be more features that you can do with schemas. And right now, it does two things. One is it gives you the little book with a little question mark, if you're in a note that matches it. The other thing is you can assign templates to it. So for example, for this thing, I can say that it has a template. And what that means is when I create a note that matches the schema, automatically apply this template to it. And so the idea of this template is going to be the name of another note. And so for example, if I just do a Lang, template, M and M Then I can say this is something inflige. And it's a note template. And the reason you have this this in the future will have different types of templates, you can make templates from snippets, or other sources. And now if I reload my index, and let's create a screen for something I don't have fishing for so let's say Lang dot java data archwing. And oh, something else that schemas that you do is it autocompletes so like, even though again, string haven't been created, it shows you Hey, this matches the dang schema. According to that schema, you happen assumptions.\n\n30:40  \nNice. So if I type in train,\n\n30:46  \nit shows you how demos will always break your hearts.\n\n30:52  \nOf course,\n\n30:54  \nthat's me.\n\n30:57  \ndelete this. So Command Shift D is to do Return note.\n\n31:03  \nAnd\n\n31:06  \nlet's try this again. I might have to reload the window for it to pick it up. So, let me I just reloaded the window. I'm going to delete this and then try to create it one more time. And then hopefully, but\n\n31:26  \nOkay, I'll look into that. But so yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.\n\n31:37  \nAnd there are other things, but these are essentially like the core parts of dendron. Something else that you can do is you can take your notes, and you can publish it to GitHub. So that's a build command. Right now, because we're in an empty space, you need to run another command to add in some pals, but basically what that when you do build power On a workspace is that it can, it'll generate, it'll turn it into static files that you can publish to GitHub. And it'll have the same template as an engine website. Um, and it's also hierarchical. So you know you the same hierarchy you happen engine you can have on your website, you can choose to publish either everything in your vault, or you can choose which hierarchies you want to publish. And then the other thing is this search bar here. This is actually also path based. So the same lookup mechanism that you use insight engine, you can also use on an engine website.\n\n32:42  \nNice. Yeah.\n\n32:43  \nCool.\n\n32:44  \nYep. Well, thank you. Yeah, no problem.\n\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/097cf7ed-e9aa-4580-86cf-0347bf7a623d.html","relUrl":"notes/097cf7ed-e9aa-4580-86cf-0347bf7a623d.html"},{"doc":"Terms","title":"Terms","hpath":"dendron.ref.terms","content":"\n### Command Palette\n\nThe [command palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette) lets you access all command based functionality inside vscode.

Dendron uses telemetry primarily for collecting usage data.\n\nThis page describes the overall telemetry approach for Dendron, what kind of data is collected and how to opt-out of data collection.\n\n## Why does Dendron collect metrics?\n\nTelemetry helps us better understand _how many users_ are using our products and _how often_ they are using our products. Unlike many telemetry services, our telemetry implementation is intentionally **limited in scope**.\n\nWe use telemetry to answer the following questions: \n  - how many people are actively using Dendron?\n  - how performant is Dendron over time and how do new changes impact performance?\n  - what features are most useful for users?\n  - what exceptions and errors are users encountering?\n\n## What is not collected\n\nDendron will **never** collect data inside your notes. We believe that your personal knowledge is for your eyes alone. \n\n## What is collected\n\nThe below is a collection of common fields that are collected\n\n| Field         | Attributes | Description                                                              |\n| ------------: | :--------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `app`         | _string_   | Currently installed version of the product (e.g. `1.0.0-rc0`)            |\n| `ideVersion`  | _string_   | Currently installed version of the IDE (e.g. `1.0.0-rc0`)                |\n| `userAgent`   | _string_   | The specific IDE in question(e.g. `VSCodium`)                            |\n| `arch`        | _string_   | Client's operating system architecture (e.g. `amd64`).                   |\n| `os`          | _string_   | Client's operating system (e.g. `darwin`).                               |\n| `nodeVersion` | _string_   | Client's node version (e.g. `v12.12.0`).                                 |\n| `anonymousId` | _string_   | Random, non-identifiable signature nanoID (e.g. `JC6NXxDa0lDFD1Mu7U2Ga`) |\n| `timestamp`   | _string_   | When the request was made                                                |\n  \n\n## When is data collected?\n\nData is collected in scenarios that are described below. \n\n### Startup \n\nWhen Dendron initializes, we collect data about on initialization time. This helps us measure the performance impact of changes that run before startup as well as improvements to our indexing performance over time. \n\n| Field       | Attributes | Description                                                         |\n| ----------: | :--------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `duration`  | _number_   | Number of seconds for startup                                       |\n| `numNotes`  | _number_   | Number of notes across all vaults (rounded to the nearest 10 notes) |\n| `numVaults` | _number_   | Number of vaults in workspace                                       |\n| `noCaching` | _boolean_  | Check whether caching is disabled                                   |\n\n\n### Tutorial Progression\n\nWhen Dendron starts for the first time, it launches users into a tutorial workflow. We track how far along the tutorial you get using the `Tutorial_{num}_Show` event. This helps us figure out how effective our intro documentation is.\n\n\n### Installation/Upgrade/Uninstall\nWhen Dendron is first installed or upgraded, we collect information about both previous and current versions. This helps us plan deprecation policies. \n\n\n| Field             | Attributes | Description                   |\n| ----------------: | :--------: | ----------------------------- |\n| `previousVersion` | _string_   | Previous version of Dendron   |\n| `duration`        | _number_   | Number of seconds for startup |\n\n### Lookup\n\nWhen lookup is performed, Dendron collects profiling information for different phases of lookup. This helps us measure the performance impact of optimizations and features we add to lookup.\n\nEvents\n- Lookup Show: when lookup is presented\n- Lookup Update: when lookup items are updated\n- Lookup Accept: when a result from lookup is accepted\n\n\n| Field           | Attributes | Description                                                                        |\n| --------------: | :--------: | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `flavor`        | _string_   | What kind of lookup (\"schema\" or \"note\")                                           |\n| `error`         | _boolean_  | Did an error happen during this phase?                                             |\n| `source`        | _string_   | What initiated the lookup? (\"onValueChange\", \"updatePickerBehavior:journal\", etc ) |\n| `createNewNote` | _boolean_  | Was a new note created during this phase?                                          |\n\n### Commands\n\nWe collect an invocation metric when a [[commands|dendron.topic.commands]] is invoked. This is to measure command latency as well as detect errors in existing and new commands\n\n\n| Field      | Attributes | Description                                  |\n| ---------: | :--------: | -------------------------------------------- |\n| `error`    | _boolean_  | Did an error happen during this phase?       |\n| `duration` | _number_   | How long did it take to execute this command |\n\n### Errors\n\nWhenever a crash happens or an unexpected error, we collect information surrounding the error to help us diagnose the problem and fix it. For more information, see [[Error Reporting|dendron.dev.errors.reporting]].\n\n| Field     | Attributes | Description                                                                                                   |\n| --------: | :--------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `ctx`     | _number_   | What happened right before the error occurred?                                                                |\n| `message` | _string_   | The error message itself                                                                                      |\n| `payload` | _string_   | Payload with diagnostics information such as exception call stacks, exception severity, and HTTP error codes. |\n\n### Other\n\nThese are groupings of other metrics we collect. We collect them to gather performance impact and improvements across various features.\n\nEvents\n- TreeView Ready: measures when the web ui based [[TreeView|dendron.ref.web-ui#treeview]] is finished loading\n\n| Field      | Attributes | Description                                           |\n| ---------: | :--------: | ----------------------------------------------------- |\n| `duration` | _number_   | How long it takes for the tree view to be initialized |\n\n### Telemetry Toggle\nWhen telemetry is disabled or enabled, we collect information about the event to let us get an estimate of the number of untracked clients\n\n|          Field | Attributes | Description                                                                            |\n| -------------: | :--------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n|      `reason` |  _enum_| Why telemetry was disabled. See values [here](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/common-server/src/analytics.ts#L73:L73) |\n\n## How to opt out of data collection\n\nIf you've disabled telemetry from the [Visual Studio Code Telemetry setting](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/telemetry), no further action is needed. You can set this option in your workspace settings, or user settings.\n\nTo disable telemetry in Dendron specifically, run the [[Disable Telemetry|dendron.topic.commands#disable-telemetry]] command.\n\n## Why not have opt-in telemetry?\n\nThe goal of telemetry is to make data driven decisions about features and use cases that can make the most difference to our users. \n\nOne way we could collect data is to conduct surveys but traditionally, these had very low participation and are also biased towards users that are already active in our community. Having telemetry allows us to collect feedback from our larger user base and avoids this bias. \n\nOpt-in telemetry, at best, gives us a narrow and biased set of users. At this point, we are back to make decisions based on limited data. Opt-out telemetry that is limited in scope is the tradeoff we made in terms of preserving user privacy while still gathering meaningful data that can help improve the product. \n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/84df871b-9442-42fd-b4c3-0024e35b5f3c.html","relUrl":"notes/84df871b-9442-42fd-b4c3-0024e35b5f3c.html"},{"doc":"Status","title":"Status","hpath":"dendron.ref.status","content":"\n\nSometimes, you'll see a `status` underneath certain features or options.

[The development of these tools, which] will give society access to and command over the inherited knowledge of the ages [should] be the first objective of our scientist\" \n>\n> - [Vannevar Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vannevar_Bush), 1945\n\nDendron's goal is to give society **access to and command over the inherited knowledge of the ages.** We launched in preview in the summer of 2020 and have had awesome traction with early adopters. We currently have over a thousand downloads and a budding community of Dendronites from around the world. \n\nTo keep up with the growth of Dendronites while continuing to work towards our roadmap, we need help. We are looking for developers to help take Dendron to the next level.\n\nDendron is built in typescript on top of VSCode. Knowledge of either is not required (though definitely preferred). You would be working alongside [myself](https://www.kevinslin.com) as well as our [global community of Dendronites](https://discord.gg/6j85zNX) to build a better way for people to **create, find, and collaborate** on knowledge that matters to them. \n\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/0f9967bc-d657-496f-9b4b-d1c7ebfd496c.html","relUrl":"notes/0f9967bc-d657-496f-9b4b-d1c7ebfd496c.html"},{"doc":"Principles","title":"Principles","hpath":"dendron.principles","content":"## Product\n\n### Speed\n\nDendron should be the fastest way for **people** to access the information they care about.\n\n- lookup should finish in under a second\n- all parts of our toolchain should optimize for speed\n\n### Scale\n\nDendron should become easier to use as you accumulate more notes. \n\n### Sensible Defaults\n\nDendron, while being configurable, should have defaults such that work for most people out of the box. \n\n### Ownership\n\nUsers should have **full control** of their data and it should be our first principle to maximize this as much as possible.\n\n### Interoperability\n\nWe aim to make it **easy** for you to use your notes in **any tool or platform** that is most useful to you.  It should be possible to import/export your data from/to any other source where a user might want to use their information.\n\n### Easy to learn, hard to master\n\n- see [Bushnell's Law\n  ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushnell%27s_Law#:~:text=Bushnell's%20Law%20or%20Nolan's%20Law,first%20quarter%20and%20the%20hundredth.)\n\n## Community\n\n### Open and Inclusive\n\nDendron is a tool for **all users** that are interested in creating, building, using, and sharing knowledge. Full stop. \n\n### Have it in writing\n\nWe don't just share what we learn in a chat at a moment in time. We make sure that the information remains accessible longer after we are gone. \n\n# Tradeoffs\n\nYou can't have something that is everything for everyone. There are tradeoffs we are making in Dendron.\n\n### Function over Form\n\n- in Dendron, it's more important for something to be useful than it is to be beautiful \n- the focus in Dendron should be about your content and the hierarchies that connect them\n\n### Focus on Hierarchies\n\n- while Dendron supports backlinks and other forms of organizing notes, Dendron's foundation is tooling to help you manage hierarchies\n\n### Focus on Speed\n\n- we can't predict the future but it's likely that no one will ever say that they wish their note taking experience to be slower\n- when thinking about features and tool chain, bias for speed\n\n### Retrieval over Insertion\n\n- all note taking tools focus on putting notes in but they struggle with helping users get notes back out, especially as users accumulate a lot of notes\n- Dendron takes the long view that you will read your notes far more than you write and optimize for getting notes back out\n\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/7fcebd7d-6411-4c9d-8baf-65629dc018a1.html","relUrl":"notes/7fcebd7d-6411-4c9d-8baf-65629dc018a1.html"},{"doc":"Mission Statement","title":"Mission Statement","hpath":"dendron.mission-statement","content":"\nOur mission is to help **people** organize and make sense of any amount of information.\n\nThis is expanded upon in our [company handbook](https://handbook.dendron.so/notes/8989a93d-8dde-4a51-bb8d-2aad761c93a1.html)\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/3bf95ba0-8d6e-4bfc-b46e-c0c66cdab2ee.html","relUrl":"notes/3bf95ba0-8d6e-4bfc-b46e-c0c66cdab2ee.html"},{"doc":"Journal","title":"Journal","hpath":"dendron.journal","content":"\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/923d1bad-74fa-4aff-bac3-9e1792db886f.html","relUrl":"notes/923d1bad-74fa-4aff-bac3-9e1792db886f.html"},{"doc":"2021","title":"2021","hpath":"dendron.journal.2021","content":"\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/ec5c992b-a6c5-42df-9da8-7c6f324095b0.html","relUrl":"notes/ec5c992b-a6c5-42df-9da8-7c6f324095b0.html"},{"doc":"02","title":"02","hpath":"dendron.journal.2021.02","content":"\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/67f35b15-a617-4ba6-9e53-d111ded53456.html","relUrl":"notes/67f35b15-a617-4ba6-9e53-d111ded53456.html"},{"doc":"20","title":"20","hpath":"dendron.journal.2021.02.20","content":"\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/68936a69-c876-4647-bfd3-1f95fe0cee19.html","relUrl":"notes/68936a69-c876-4647-bfd3-1f95fe0cee19.html"},{"doc":"Migration","title":"Migration","hpath":"dendron.journal.2021.02.20.migration","content":"\n## Workspace Upgrade\n\nWe recently ( 2021.02.13 ) upgraded Dendron's backend to use [Yarn Workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/). \n\nThis comes with a bunch of [[performance and size improvements|dendron.release.changelog#house-cleaning]] when developing Dendron.\n\nIf you currently have Dendron checked out, you'll need to run the following commands to migrate over to using the yarn build method. \n\n```sh\n# get latest version\ngit pull\n\nnpm install -g yarn\n# remove old node_modules\n./bootstrap/scripts/cleanup.sh\nyarn bootstrap:bootstrap\nyarn bootstrap:build \n\n```","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/acd429ee-c458-421d-a087-ea0da07b64e0.html","relUrl":"notes/acd429ee-c458-421d-a087-ea0da07b64e0.html"},{"doc":"Jobs","title":"Jobs","hpath":"dendron.jobs","content":"\nHelp us create a better tool for thought.\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/c378b702-7d49-4e91-be6e-b2078103c86e.html","relUrl":"notes/c378b702-7d49-4e91-be6e-b2078103c86e.html"},{"doc":"What We Run On","title":"What We Run On","hpath":"dendron.jobs.what-we-run-on","content":"\n- our stack is all Typescript\n- our frontend is React and Next.js \n- our backend is express.js\n- our infrastructure consists of serverless technologies built on top of AWS\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/zhXmCnOFUWeKBSTNTy9Dq.html","relUrl":"notes/zhXmCnOFUWeKBSTNTy9Dq.html"},{"doc":"What We Offer","title":"What We Offer","hpath":"dendron.jobs.what-we-offer","content":"\n- real salaries, founding level equity (with a 7 year exercise window), flexible titles\n- work in the open (source)\n- a remote first workplace\n- personal learning budget ($1500/year) for anything that helps you grow\n- be part of the solution to information overload\n\nSee [Dendron Benefits](https://handbook.dendron.so/notes/ab6f0f19-b9a7-4692-adef-5239adc874cb.html) for further details ","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/eCPft8k7n6TPW69POlUdh.html","relUrl":"notes/eCPft8k7n6TPW69POlUdh.html"},{"doc":"Senior Webdev","title":"Senior Webdev","hpath":"dendron.jobs.senior-webdev","content":"\nDendron is an open source knowledge management platform built inside the IDE.

You can get version numbers by running the following commands\n\n```sh\nnpm info @dendronhq/dendron-cli\n``` -->\n\n## Plugin \n\n### Dendron is stuck on loading\n- fixes:\n  - [[Whitelisting localhost|dendron.guides.troubleshooting#whitelisting-localhost]]\n\n### Engine not Initialized\n- cause: \n  - 1. You are not running inside a workspace\n  - 2. Localhost is blocked\n- diagnose\n  - 1. See fix\n  - 2. Look for `ECONNREFUSED` in the [[logs|dendron.topic.commands#dendrondev-open-logs]]\n- fix: \n  - 1.

[[Whitelisting localhost|dendron.guides.troubleshooting#whitelisting-localhost]]\n\n### Notes from the graph/tree view show wrong results\n- cause: Views are out of sync\n- fix: [[Reload Dendron|dendron.guides.troubleshooting#reload-dendron]]\n\n### Preview not Rendering Correctly\n- causes: Using the built-in preview instead of the Dendron preview\n- fixes: [[Use Dendron Markdown Preview|dendron.guides.troubleshooting#use-dendron-markdown-preview]]\n\n### Lookup Shortcut is not working\n- causes:\n  - you have the vim extension installed and its overriding the default dendron shortcut\n- fix: \n  1. open command palette and run `Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)`\n  2. add the following shortcut override\n    - NOTE: replace `cmd+l` with `ctrl+l` if you are on windows\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"key\": \"cmd+l\",\n    \"command\": \"-expandLineSelection\",\n    \"when\": \"textInputFocus\"\n  }\n  ```\n\n### Cannot read property 'name' of undefined\n\nThis is an issue with upgrading to 0.47.0. If you are encountering this, you'll want to copy the following into `dendron.yml`\n\n```yml\njournal:\n    dailyDomain: daily\n    name: journal\n    dateFormat: y.MM.dd\n    addBehavior: childOfDomainNamespace\n    firstDayOfWeek: 1\n```\n\n\n\n## Upgrading\n\n### Error upgrading\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/trouble.upgrade.png)\n\nDendron will update keybindings/settings/etc to the latest defaults if not currently set on upgrade. If you see the above error, it means that Dendron had trouble parsing one of your settings files. This doesn't stop dendron from starting but it does mean that the latest settings aren't being applied.\n\nThe most likely culprit of this error is a bad snippets file. To fix, bring up the command prompt, type `>Configure User Snippets`, open `dendron.code-snippets` and see if there's anything funky with the json on the line mentioned by the error. You can also use tools like [jsonlint](https://jsonlint.com/) to validate your JSON.\n\n## Schemas\n\n### I'm getting a `you cannot define a mapping item when in a sequence` when trying to define a schema\n\nThat means there's an issue with your yaml. You can paste it in [yaml lint](http://www.yamllint.com/) to check that you are using the correct yaml syntax. \n\n### Schema Templates aren't working\n\nSchema templates are defined as YAML objects. The most common mistake is putting them down as a list\n\nFor example, this is a valid schema.\n\n```yml\n- id: journal\n  title: journal\n  desc: \"\"\n  parent: root\n  children: \n    - daily\n- id : daily\n  namespace: true\n  template:\n    id: journal.template.daily\n    type: note\n```\n\nThis is not a valid schema.\n\n```yml\n- id: journal\n  title: journal\n  desc: \"\"\n  parent: root\n  children: \n    - daily\n- id : daily\n  namespace: true\n  template:\n    - id: journal.template.daily\n      type: note\n```\n\n## Markdown Preview\n\n### Why can't I click the checkbox?\n\nIt could be that you are using the VSCode default markdown instead of Dendron's Markdown Preview. \n\n![[dendron.guides.troubleshooting#using-the-wrong-preview,1:#*]]\n\n### Still initializing.  Please close this window and try again after Dendron has been initialized.\n\nWhen Dendron starts up, it initializes a local server which is responsible for indexing notes and fetching note metadata. Plugins like the preview depend on the server being initialized before activating. You'll know the server is initialized after you see a `Dendron is activated` notification.\n\n### Get the logs\n\nOpen the [[output view|dendron.topic.workbench#output-view]] and use the dropdown menu to find the log titled `DENDRON`. \n\n\n## Linux\n\n### Reference to Another Note on Ubuntu\n\nIf Ctrl+Shift+R (reference to another note) doesn't work on Ubuntu, do `sudo apt install xsel`.\n\n## Publishing\n\n### Can't open local preview\n\nDendron runs the preview on port 8080. Make sure you don't have something already running there.\n\n- windows\n```powershell\n# get ids of processes\nGet-Process -Id (Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 8080).OwningProcess\n\n# if you see any result, you can stop them using the following command\nStop-process -Id {IDS_FROM_ABOVE}\n```\n\n- linux\n```bash\n# get ids\nlsof -l -n -P -i tcp:8080 \n\n# kill\nkill -9 {IDS}\n```\n\n## Etc\n\n### Error: spawn git ENOENT\n\nCheck if you have git installed. You can find more details [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42545885/vs-code-error-spawn-git-enoent)\n\n### Clicking on the link creates multiple files\n\nThis is likely due to other extensions that you have installed that provide conflicting definitions for [[wiki links|dendron.topic.links#wiki-links]].\n\nThe most likely culprits are `foam` or `markdown-notes`. Uninstalling them will fix this issue. \n\nYou can see your installed \n\n### Dendron fails to initialize\n\n- check if you have a file with two consecutive dots: `eg. pro..foo.bar`\n\n### Multiple Vaults with the same name\n\nYou will get this if you have multiple [[vaults|dendron.topic.config.dendron#vaults]] that have the same name. This is an error with Dendron since Dendron requires all vault names be unique. You can fix this by removing the duplicate vaults or setting a unique [[name|dendron.topic.config.dendron#name]] property for the vault.  \n\n\n## Common Diagnostics\n\n### Launch a new workspace\n\nTo check if there is something wrong with Dendron vs your particular workspace setup, launch Dendron in a new workspace by running [[Initialize Workspace|dendron.topic.commands#initialize-workspace]]. \n\n## Common Fixes\n\n### Uninstall Conflicting Extensions\nMarkdown Notes, Markdown Preview Enhanced, and Markdown All in One are known to interfere with Dendron\n\n### Reload Dendron\n\nSometimes Dendron views can get out of sync with notes. To fix, run `Dendron: Reload Index` to manually sync. If that doesn't work, you can also try `Developer: Reload Window` to restart VSCode.\n\n### Remove notes that extend from root\n\nWe currently don't support creating children of `root.md` This note is special. While the contents can be edited, creating a hierarchy off root is not officially supported\n\n### Run Dendron inside a Workspace\n\nDendron requires a VSCode [workspace file](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces#_opening-workspace-files) to operate. Make sure to open the **dendron.code-workspace** file by following the instructions [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces#_opening-workspace-files)\n\nYou can have Dendron create one if you hold down \"Cmd+Shift+P\" (CTRL+SHIFT+P on windows) and use the [[Launch Tutorial Command|dendron.topic.commands#launch-tutorial]]\n\n### Clear the cache\n\nDelete dendron [[cache|dendron.ref.caching#summary]] files.\n\n### Whitelisting localhost\n\nDendron starts a [[local server|dendron.dev.design#overview]] in the background and the plugin connects to it to index notes. Check that you don't have anything that is running or blocking localhost.\n\n### Correctly Format the Note\n\nDendron can sometimes fail to load due to a malformed note. Common issues:\n- [[Frontmatter|dendron.topic.frontmatter]] is missing\n- frontmatter has no id\n\n### Look for large files\n\nDendron currently has trouble parsing notes larger than 1MB in size. Check if you have any notes like this and move them out of your workspace.\n\n### Book a one on one\n\nIf all else fails, schedule a diagnostic session. \n\n## Send a support request\n\nIf none of the troubleshooting methods work, you can ping kevin on Discord or submit a github issue.\n\nWhen doing either of these things, please include the following information:\n\n- [[Plugin Logs|dendron.guides.cook#checking-logs]]\n- [[Server Logs|dendron.guides.cook#server-logs]]\n- Contents of your [[workspace settings|dendron.guides.settings]]\n- Contents of [[dendron.yml|dendron.topic.commands#configure-yaml]]\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/a6c03f9b-8959-4d67-8394-4d204ab69bfe.html","relUrl":"notes/a6c03f9b-8959-4d67-8394-4d204ab69bfe.html"},{"doc":"Archive","title":"Archive","hpath":"dendron.guides.troubleshooting.archive","content":"\nThese are old troubleshooting issues that should no longer be relevant\n\n### Use Dendron Markdown Preview\n\nThe VSCode default markdown preview has the same icon as Dendron's Markdown Preview.  It is currently not possible to disable the builtin preview (we are looking into fixing this [here](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/42)).\n\nMeanwhile, you can open Dendron's markdown preview by clicking the preview button on the left of the menu bar or by using the `> Markdown Preview Enhanced: Open Preview to the Side` command\n\n![Markdown preview](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/trouble-md.png)","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/o6fK2r9YLNTqd8w76hRrv.html","relUrl":"notes/o6fK2r9YLNTqd8w76hRrv.html"},{"doc":"Tips","title":"Tips","hpath":"dendron.guides.tips","content":"\n## Bucket\n\n### Peeking\n\nIt is possible to [peek](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/editingevolved#_peek) at wiki-links in Dendron.

This is really helpful for prioritizing todos among other things ✅\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/tips-move-lines.gif)\n\n### Search Editor\n\n- [docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_43#_search-editors)\n\nAlso known as the coolest feature in vscode that most people have never heard of. This lets you view and save your search results in a full blown text editor. You can combine it with Dendron's hierarchies to do some amazing things, like aggregating all your todos and scoping your search to a specific hierarchy. \n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/tips.search-editor.gif)\n\nYou can open search editor via keyboard shortcut. I use it to start a search with the current filename. works really well with Dendron hierarchies.\n\n```json\n  {\n    \"key\": \"ctrl+s f\",\n    \"command\": \"search.action.openNewEditor\",\n    \"args\": {\n      \"query\": \"\",\n      \"triggerSearch\": false,\n      \"focusResults\": false,\n      \"includes\": \"${fileBasenameNoExtension}\",\n    }\n  }\n```\n\n### Stylized Tags Using Custom CSS\n\nTo customize the look and feel of your tags, you can do so by using the following convention and [CSS edits](https://www.dendron.so/notes/683740e3-70ce-4a47-a1f4-1f140e80b558.html#can-i-customize-the-markdown-preview-css).\n\nLet's say you have a `books` hierarchy and you have a `books.high-growth-handbook` note. You have all the tags you use for books under a `books.tags.` namespace.\n\nIf you use links for tags: `[[#business|books.tags.business]]`, you can use this CSS to customize their look:\n\n```css\n/* General tag styling */\na[href*=\"tag.\"] {\n    color: #000;\n    background: #fff;\n    display: inline-block;\n    padding: 0 10px;\n    border-radius: 4px;\n}\n/* Customizing the look of specific tags */\na[href*=\".tags.business\"] {\n    color: #fff;\n    background: rgb(36, 89, 233);\n}\n```\n\nThe result looks like this:\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/tips.tags.png)\n\n### Collapsing Headers and Bullets\n\nYou can collapse headers at different levels and bullets at different indentation levels inside VSCode. \n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/tips.toggle-bullets.gif)\n\n\n### Create a new note in a deeply nested hierarchy \n- [discord thread](https://discordapp.com/channels/717965437182410783/735365126227493004/758235198403117087)\n\n- Problem: \n   - You are currently in `foo` and you want to create the note `foo.child1.child2.my-note`. You don't want to type out the full path. Is there an easier way to create `my-note` than typing out the full path?\n- Solution: \n  - VSCode doesn't support autocomplete inside the quick input widget which Dendron uses for lookups. We are experimenting with different ways of getting around this. \n  - Today, the workaround is to create a wiki-link inside another note and navigate via link to create it. \n  - Another method, if you know you will be creating multiple children under a single deeply nested parent, is to pin the parent and create the child from the parent \n\n<a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/f0bbfc9cae0a474a99f8a1169b7b96c7\">\n<img style=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/f0bbfc9cae0a474a99f8a1169b7b96c7-with-play.gif\"> </a>\n\n\n### Automate Git Tasks\n- [discord thread](https://discordapp.com/channels/717965437182410783/742532267058004098/759130627781558403)\n- Problem:\n  - You want an easier way to `git add && git commit && git push`\n- Solution #1:\n  - Use [git automator](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ivangabriele.vscode-git-add-and-commit).\n- Solution #2:\n  - Add alias to your bashrc/zshrc along the lines of \n  ```\n  # WARNING: pushes straight to the main/master branch.

Paths below are relative to your workspace root.\n\nIgnore the shadow directories in `.gitignore`:\n\n```\ngitignore\n# Dendron\n/docs/assets/\n/docs/notes/\n/docs/_site/\n\n# npm\n/node_modules/\n```\n\n1. Create a `package.json` to install the package:\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"scripts\": {\n      \"dendron\": \"dendron-cli\"\n    },\n    \"repository\": {\n      \"type\": \"git\",\n      \"url\": \"git+https://github.com/{{username}}/{{repo}}.git\"\n    },\n    \"license\": \"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International\",\n    \"devDependencies\": {\n      \"@dendronhq/dendron-cli\": \"*\"\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n2.  Create the workflow \n  ```\n  mkdir -p .github/workflows\n  touch .github/workflows/dendron.yml\n  ```\n  Add the following\n  ```yaml\n  name: Dendron\n\n  on:\n    push:\n      branches:\n      - main\n\n  jobs:\n    build:\n      runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n      steps:\n      - name: Checkout source\n        uses: actions/checkout@v2\n\n      - name: Install npm dependencies\n        run: npm install\n\n      - name: Build pod\n        run: npm run dendron-cli -- buildSite --wsRoot . --stage prod\n\n      - name: Deploy site\n        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3\n        with:\n          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n          publish_branch: pages\n          publish_dir: docs/\n          force_orphan: true\n          enable_jekyll: false\n  ```\n  3. Commit all your changes\n  ```\n  git add .\n  git commit -m \"add dendron action\"\n  ```\n  4. Create the pages branch\n  Configure your repository's Pages settings as follows:\n  ```\n  git checkout -b pages\n  git push -u origin HEAD\n  ```\n  5. Update pages branch on github\n  - go to the pages settings, eg. `https://github.com/dendronhq/seed.services/settings/pages`\n    - choose the following\n    ```\n    * _Branch_: `pages`\n    * _Folder_: _/ (root)_\n    ```\n\nFinally, commit these three files and push them to your `master` branch. Within a few seconds you should see the workflow run, your `pages` branch get updated and your Pages build start.\n\n### Go back to previous Note\n\nUse \"> Quick Open Previous Recently Used...` to navigate through recently opened notes\n  - default shortcut: `CTRL-TAB`\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/tips.tabs.most-recent.gif)\n\n\n### Keep Track of Tabs\n\nIt's really easy to lose sight of your tabs, especially with menu items occluding the little horizontal space you have for tabs. \n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/tips.tabs.nav.jpg)\n\nInstead of relying on the menu, you can use `Show All Editors` to see all tabs via a dropdown. You can also narrow down tabs after selection.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/tips.tabs.editors.gif)\n\nYou can streamline this process by assigning a keyboard shortcut to the command. Below is an example.\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"key\": \"ctrl+t\",\n    \"command\": \"workbench.action.showAllEditors\"\n  }\n  ```\n\n\n### Copy and Paste Web Content into Dendron\n\nFirst copy it into Notion or use the notion web clipper to clip it. This will format it nicely in markdown. You can then paste it into Dendron with markdown and everything :)\n\n<!-- \n\n### Custom Outlines\n\nTODO: need to add more details\n\nOutlines are super helpful but there are not always feasible depending on the file format\n\n![](/assets/images/2020-09-21-19-33-21.png)\n\nIn those situations, I like to leave markers inside a note and use the search editor to surface those markers \n\n<a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/eabf90dbc74e4a1facd5e82bd76a6134\"> \n<p>Tips - Breadcrumbs - Watch Video</p> \n<img style=\"max-width:300px;\" src=\"https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/eabf90dbc74e4a1facd5e82bd76a6134-with-play.gif\"> </a>\n\nhttps://www.loom.com/share/eabf90dbc74e4a1facd5e82bd76a6134\n\nYou can use the same technique \n\n# Generating all journal notes ahead of time\n\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/25701265/how-to-generate-a-list-of-all-dates-in-a-range-using-the-tools-available-in-bash\n-->\n\n## Workbench\n\n### Navigating a hierarchy\n\nOne easy way of navigating hierarchies it to click on the file name. This will reveal a dropdown that shows you all siblings of the current note. \n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/guide.siblings.jpg)\n\n### Remove Markdown Buttons in Menu Bar\n- [discord thread](https://discordapp.com/channels/717965437182410783/739186036495876126/758408534848831558)\n\n```json\n\"markdownShortcuts.icons.bold\": false,\n\"markdownShortcuts.icons.italic\": false,\n\"markdownShortcuts.icons.strikethrough\": false,\n\"markdownShortcuts.icons.bullets\": false,\n```\n\n### Moving Panes\n\nYou can move vscode tabs using the following builtin commands:\n- `View: Move Editor Into Next Group`\n- `View: Move Editor Into Previous Group`\n\nThey are mapped on to the following keyboard shortcuts:\n- mac: `cmd+ctrl+left|right`\n\nThis is helpful for looking at your notes side by side. \n\n<a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/d99ec9cce8ff4d869cf8c36955152808\"> \n<img style=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/d99ec9cce8ff4d869cf8c36955152808-with-play.gif\"> </a>\n\n### Pinning Tabs\n\nYou can pin tabs in VSCode by right clicking on a tab and selecting `Pin Tab`. \n\nThe latest VSCode lets you control pin behavior for tabs. It's not currently documented as of 2020.09.28 but as of the latest insider build, it has a few different options to control the pinned behavior. \n\n- options:\n  - normal (default), normal tab size with a pin icon\n  - shrink: reduced tab size with some text visible\n  - compact: only icon visible\n\n```json\n\"workbench.editor.pinnedTabSizing\": \"shrink\"\n```\n\n\n### Zen Mode\n\nVSCode can be visually noisy. You can hide most of the UI by toggling `Zen Mode` with a three panel layout. \n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/tips.zen.jpg)\n\nThe following setting overrides are useful: \n\n```json\n// by default, zen mode will open a new \"workspace\" which I don't like\n\"zenMode.fullScreen\": false,\n// I'm a vim user so I like my line numbers\n\"zenMode.hideLineNumbers\": false,\n```\n\nTo navigate tabs and look at the breadcrumb outline, You can use the following commands\n\n```json\nworkbench.action.showAllEditors -> (no shortcut by default, consider mapping to ctrl + t)\nbreadcrumbs.focusAndSelect -> cmd + t\n```\n\nYou can see a video of this workflow in the video below.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/dd27df6d556d4ba6b28b2028ca7d1455\"> \n<img style=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/dd27df6d556d4ba6b28b2028ca7d1455-with-play.gif\"> </a>\n\n\n## Snippets\n\n### Have links auto-complete without additional key presses\n\n- Update your settings to the following\n```json\n// The following settings will only apply to markdown files:\n  \"[markdown]\": {\n    // quickSuggestions true will provide suggestions as you type.\n    // If you turn this on and DO NOT want suggestions\n    // for non-wiki-link, non-tag words,\n    \"editor.quickSuggestions\": true,\n    // This is poorly documented, but seems to offer suggestions\n    // from any word in open document when turned on, which\n    // can be a little distracting in markdown docs:\n    \"editor.wordBasedSuggestions\": false,\n    \"editor.tabSize\": 2,\n    // Set this to false if you turn on quickSuggestions\n    // but don't want suggestions for markdown related snippets\n    // as you type:\n    \"editor.suggest.showSnippets\": false,\n  },\n```\n\n## Markdown\n\n### Always have the preview open\n\n\nYou can add the following setting to your workspace to always have a markdown editor show up with your content. \n\n```json\n\"markdown-preview-enhanced.automaticallyShowPreviewOfMarkdownBeingEdited\": true,\n```\n\n### Symbol search\n\nWhen using the standard file-search in vscode (`ctrl-P`), you can search for all titles in your workspace if you use the starting keyword `#`\n\nExample: if i know i had a header with the title \"cheatsheet\", i can type in `# cheatsheet`\n\n### Auto bullet list\n\nVSCode doesn't support auto-formatting by default. You can use the following workaround to mimic the behavior.\n\n\n- Add list-item below current position. Using `-`\n```json\n{\n        \"key\": \"shift+enter\",\n        \"command\": \"type\",\n        \"args\": {\n            \"text\": \"\\r\\n- \"\n        },\n        \"when\": \"editorTextFocus && !editorReadOnly && editorLangId == 'markdown'\"\n}\n```\n\n- Add list-item below current position. Using `*`\n\n```json\n{\n        \"key\": \"shift+enter\",\n        \"command\": \"type\",\n        \"args\": {\n            \"text\": \"\\r\\n* \"\n        },\n        \"when\": \"editorTextFocus && !editorReadOnly && editorLangId == 'markdown'\"\n}\n```\n\n> Credit for this recipe goes to @Stigs#0135 \n\n### Academic Notes with Templates  \n\nWith Dendron's [[schema templates|dendron.topic.schema#template]] you can make templates that are applied automatically whenever you create reading notes. You can even make different templates for different types of sources. For instance, you can have one template for articles and another for books.\n\n- Add an `article.schema.yml` schema file that applies an `article.template.notes.md` template file\n- Add a `book.schema.yml` schema file that applies a `book.template.notes.md` template file\n- Add other schema and template files with relevant patterns for conference presentations, TED talks, edited collections, etc.\n\nYou can adopt or adapt these schema template files for [books and articles](https://github.com/ryan-p-randall/some-dendron-starter-files).\n\nOnce you've made similar schema and template files, when you make a new file using the [[lookup bar|dendron.topic.lookup.create]], the template will be applied to your new note in the corresponding schema's domain. A new note with a name like `article.hall-stuart-encoding-decoding.notes` will apply the article template, and a new note with a name like `book.hooks-bell-feminism-is-for-everybody.notes` will apply the book template.\n\n## Other Tools\n\nThis is a list of other tools that work well with Dendron.\n- [nvAlt](https://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/): local markdown editor that works well with Dendron notes (mac only)\n\n## Other VSCode Extensions\n\n### Git\n- [Git Automator](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ivangabriele.vscode-git-add-and-commit): one command to commit and push all changes\n- [Git Doc](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsls-contrib.gitdoc): auto-commit and (optionally) auto push your notes at fixed intervals\n- [Gitlens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens): Repository/File/Line history and annotations of all your files\n- [Path AutoComplete](https://github.com/ionutvmi/path-autocomplete): Path autocomplete for VSCode\n\n### Coding\n- [Code Runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.code-runner)\n\n### Other\n- [Macros](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=geddski.macros): Define custom macros \n- [Vim](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim): VIM key bindings 😍\n- [Bookmarks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alefragnani.Bookmarks): Bookmark lines within File [Vertical Limit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=generik.vertical-limit): Work with multiple cursors and blocks of text\n- [CodeUI](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ryanraposo.codeui): Easier customization of every part of the VSCode UI\n- [Open in Typora](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cyberbiont.vscode-open-in-typora&utm_source=VSCode.pro&utm_campaign=AhmadAwais): Open note in Typora\n- [Profile Switcher](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaronpowell.vscode-profile-switcher): Create different set of extension profiles\n\n## Other Browser Extensions\n\n### Web Clipper\n- [Markdown Web](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdownload-markdown-web/pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi?hl=en-GB): markdown based web clipper\n- [Roam Highlighter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mcoimieglmhdjdoplhpcmifgplkbfibp)\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/692fa114-f798-467f-a0b9-3cccc327aa6f.html","relUrl":"notes/692fa114-f798-467f-a0b9-3cccc327aa6f.html"},{"doc":"Settings","title":"Settings","hpath":"dendron.guides.settings","content":"You can update Dendron settings by using the VSCode workspace settings by using the command prompt to `Preferences: Open Workspace Settings`\n\n<a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/2d8eaeb6fddf4c76a390d3894b497435\"> \n<img style=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/2d8eaeb6fddf4c76a390d3894b497435-with-play.gif\"> </a>\n\nIf you are comfortable with editing raw JSON, you can use `Preferences: Open Workspace Settings (JSON)` to work with the settings in raw JSON\n\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/26d66e84-6e4f-4688-bf6e-af070def7c38.html","relUrl":"notes/26d66e84-6e4f-4688-bf6e-af070def7c38.html"},{"doc":"Migration","title":"Migration","hpath":"dendron.guides.migration","content":"This note covers migrating your notes from other tools\n\n## Obsidian\n\n1.

Afterwards, you can install it by the extended options in the extensions pane.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/trouble.install.gif)\n\n### Checking Logs\n\nYou can diagnose most problems by checking the logs. You can view the logs using the [[Open Logs Command|dendron.topic.commands#dendrondev-open-logs]]\n\n#### Server Logs\n\nDendron has two sets of logs - client and server. The client logs you can access using the `Open Logs Command`. You can access the server logs by following the tutorial [here](https://www.loom.com/share/3d04cb1d6f904ac099d73e083e62ee2f).\n\n#### Logs from previous session\n\nDendron has logs for the current session and the previous session.\n\nYou can get logs of the previous session by following instructions [here](https://www.loom.com/share/2ca740e8e09b4aaf927d8098e2e6dec0)\n\n## Bucket\n\n### Star/Favorite/Pin Notes\n\nDendron doesn't currently provide native support for this. You can download the [Bookmarks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alefragnani.Bookmarks) extension to achieve the functionality in the interim.\n\n### Launch the command palette\n\nThis lets you execute commands inside vscode\n\n-   Linux: `Ctrl+Shift+P`\n-   macOS: `Cmd+Shift+P`\n-   Windows: `Ctrl+Shift+P`\n\n### Analyze notes using elasticsearch\n\n-   WARNING: this is advanced material\n\nWith Dendron, you can export your notes using the [[JSON Export Pod|dendron.topic.pod]] and then use that data to analyze your notes using elasticsearch.\n\nThis video walkthrough walks you through that process.\n<a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/c85c7c81d8aa4e97b4bbdf2245ca8f9b\"> <img style=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/c85c7c81d8aa4e97b4bbdf2245ca8f9b-with-play.gif\"> </a>\n\nYou can download the repo used in this walkthrough from [github](https://github.com/dendronhq/sample-elasticsearch-demo)\n\nPre-requisites:\n\n-   download and run elasticsearch\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Export your data using the JSON Export Pod\n2. Create an index in elasticsearch (we're using version 7.9)\n\n```json\nPUT notes\n{\n  \"mappings\": {\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"created\": {\n        \"type\":   \"date\",\n        \"format\": \"epoch_millis\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n3. Pipe exported JSON into the newly created index.\n\n```bash\ncat /path/to/exported/notes.json | jq -c '.[] | {\"index\": {\"_index\": \"notes\", \"notes\", \"_id\": .id}}, .' | curl -H'Content-Type: application/json' -XPOST localhost:9200/_bulk --data-binary @-\n```\n\n4. Profit!\n\nSome potential use cases you can do using elasticsearch and Dendron:\n\n-   filter your notes by any logical combination of custom attributes\n-   make a heatmap of notes created by date\n-   get a full list of tags used across your vault and on a per hierarchy basis\n-   anything else you can thin of :)\n\nSome useful additional links:\n\n-   [elasticsearch docs](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/elasticsearch-intro.html)\n-   [elasticsearch vscode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ria.elastic)\n\n### Convert timestamps in the frontmatter\n\nCurrently, Dendron notes show timestamps in epoch time which is not the most parsable for humans. You can use the [timestamp converter extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Stalinbalraj.timestamp-converter) order to see a human representation of said timestamp.\n\n### Use Dendron with Anki\n\n-   [Anki for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jasew.anki)\n\n### Use Dendron on a separate instance of VS Code\n\nYou can use Dendron on a separate instance of VS Code by launching it with the [command line flags](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/command-line#_advanced-cli-options) `--user-data-dir` and `--extensions-dir`:\n\n```\ncode --user-data-dir=/path/to/code-dendron --extensions-dir=/path/to/code-dendron-ext\n```\n\n### Mobile Support\n\nDendron does not have a dedicated mobile client at this time. There are numerous mobile markdown editors that can be used to view and edit Dendron notes. Some popular options are listed below:\n\n-   [Git Journal](https://github.com/GitJournal/GitJournal)\n-   [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer)\n-   [Epsilon Notes](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ekartoyev.enotes&hl=en_US&gl=US)\n-   [Neutrinote](https://neutrinote.wordpress.com/) (Android only)\n-   [Noteless](https://github.com/redsolver/noteless) (Android only). This _just_ received experimental Dendron support so worth trying out.\n-   [Markor](https://github.com/gsantner/markor) (Android only)\n\nMost mobile apps do not have git support.\n\n-   If you are on iOS, you can follow the instructions [here](https://victoria.dev/blog/a-remote-sync-solution-for-ios-and-linux-git-and-working-copy/) to sync your git backed Dendron with any note taking tool on iOS.\n-   If you are on Android, you can read [this writeup](https://mstempl.netlify.app/post/working-with-git-on-android/) by one of users on having Git Sync on Android devices\n\n### WebClipper\n\nYou can use the [markdownload-markdown-web](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdownload-markdown-web/pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi) extension to clip content as markdown from Chrome.\n\n### Regex\n\nTo get familiar with regex syntax, try [regexr](https://regexr.com/) is a great place to experiment with different queries.\n\n### Automatically Convert Casing on a Note\n\nYou can use the [string converter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=adamwalzer.string-converter) extension to change `[[normal note with spaces]]` to `[[normal-note-with-spaces]]` as well as a series of other text transformations.\n\n## Markdown Preview\n\n### Prevent newly opened files from replacing the preview pane?\n\nSet the following option in your workspace settings\n\n```json\n\"markdown-preview-enhanced.automaticallyShowPreviewOfMarkdownBeingEdited\": true,\n```\n\n### Customize Theme\n\nTo change the color theme, you can update the `markdown-preview-enhanced.previewTheme` vscode setting\n\n### Customize CSS\n\nYou can see instructions for customizing css [here](https://shd101wyy.github.io/markdown-preview-enhanced/#/customize-css)\n\n## VSCode\n\n### Use Dendron with a current folder\n\n-   1. start by initializing a workspace\n\n![[dendron.topic.commands#initialize-workspace:#*]]\n\n-   2. by default, dendron uses a `vaults` folder underneath your workspace to store you vaults. Update your [[settings|dendron.guides.settings]] and change `vault` to the path of your current notes (alternatively, you can also copy your current notes into `vault`)\n\n```\n\"folders\": [\n    {\n        \"path\": \"vault\"\n    },\n    ...\n],\n```\n\n-   3. Run `> Dendron: Reload Index` for Dendron to pick up changes\n\n### Access Dendron Workspace from multiple windows\n\nThere are usually two scenarios:\n\n1. you want two windows of different workspaces\n2. you want two windows of the same workspace\n\n-   for 1, create a new window and initialize a new workspace in some directory that is different from your first workspace\n-   for 2, you have a few options\n    -   a. initialize a new workspace in a different directory. open the settings using `> Open User Workspace settings (JSON)`. change the folder to the path of your vault in the initial workspace. run `> Reload Window` for the changes to take affect\n    -   b. use a different version of vscode to open the same workspace (eg. vscode insider, vscodium, vscode regular). you need to do this because vscode will re-use the same window when opening the same workspace\n\n### Change the sorting order in the Outline Panel\n\nClick the three little dots next to outline to change the sorting order. You can sort by **Name** (alphabetical) or **Position** (linear order)\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/cook.vscode.outline.jpg)\n\n### Change the sorting oder in the Explorer Panel\n\nSee instructions [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51543871/sorting-files-in-vs-code-explorer)\n\n### Drag and Drop files into Dendron\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/cook.drag.jpg)\n\nTo drag files into Dendron, open the workspace pane on the side to drag and drop. We currently recommend you only do this for non-markdown files that you want to link to inside your vaults.\n\n### Find Installed Extensions\n\n1. Navigate to the extensions pane\n2. Search for `@installed`\n\n### Add Dendron to application launchers on Linux desktops\n\nLinux desktop systems often include application launchers where you can see the applications installed on your computer and launch them. You can add an entry for Dendron to the application launcher by creating a file at `~/.local/share/applications/dendron.desktop`, then pasting the following contents into it.\n\n```\n[Desktop Entry]\nComment=A personal knowledge management tool that grows as you do.\nExec=code --no-sandbox --new-window ~/Dendron/dendron.code-workspace\nName=Dendron\nType=Application\nStartupWMClass=code\nKeywords=dendron;notes;pkm;\nCategories=Utility;TextEditor;\n```\n\nMake sure the path to the dendron workspace matches your setup. Then, run `update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications/` in a terminal or restart your system. You should now see Dendron in the launcher under the Utilities section, or if you search for Dendron in your launcher. Launching Dendron from here will launch VSCode with your Dendron workspace open.\n\n## Navigation\n\n### Enable Table of Contents\n\nWhen viewing your notes locally, you can view the toc from the outline view.\n\n-   from the outline\n    ![[dendron.topic.workbench#outline-view,1:#*]]\n\n\n## Publishing\n\n### Incremental Builds\n\nYou can do incremental builds from Jekyll and Dendron\n\n-   when previewing the site locally, add the `incremental` flag\n    ```bash\n    bundle exec jekyll s --watch --incremental\n    ```\n-   when building the site, also add an incremental flag\n    -   NOTE: you'll need `rsync` installed to use the incremental flag\n\n```bash\ndendron-cli buildSite --wsRoot {path/to/ws} --vault {path/to/vault} --incremental\n```\n\n### Automatically Update Site while editing\n\nThe following instructions cover how to update your local preview everytime you make a change to your notes\n\n-   install `dendron-cli`\n    ![[dendron.topic.cli#installation,1:#*]]\n\n-   have jekyll watch your site-root\n\n```bash\ncd {your-site-root}\nbundle exec jekyll s --watch\n```\n\n-   use `nodemon` to watch your vault\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g nodemon\nnodemon --watch {path/to/vault} --ext md dendron-cli buildSite --wsRoot {path/to/ws} --vault {path/to/vault}\n```\n\n-   NOTE: you can combine this with incremental builds to have the best editing experience\n\n### Publish password protected site using AWS Amplify\n\nYou can access the site with username: `dendron`, password: `hierarchy`.\n\n-   NOTE: this requires hosting your site on AWS. For most people, this will end up costing you a few cents a month.\n\n#### Setup your github repo\n\n1. Create a new github repo using this [template](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron-amplify-template).\n2. In your Dendron workspace, remove the `docs` directory and clone your newly created repository\n    ```bash\n    cd {your-workspace}\n    rm -r docs\n    git clone {your-repo} docs\n    ```\n\n#### Setup aws\n\n1. Create an [aws account](https://aws.amazon.com/)\n2. Login to your AWS account and go select the [Amplify Service](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/home?region=us-west-2#/)\n    - ![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/amplify.select.jpg)\n3. Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/getting-started.html) to connect your github with your amplify\n4. Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/access-control.html) to restrict access to your site.\n5. Verify that your site is now password protected\n\n#### Publish your notes\n\n1. Update `siteRepoDir` in `dendron.yml` with the location of your github directory\n    - Your `dendron.yml` should look similar to the one below\n        ```yml\n        site:\n            copyAssets: true\n            siteHierarchies:\n                - root\n            siteRootDir: docs\n            usePrettyRefs: true\n            siteRepoDir: docs\n        ```\n2. Run `> Dendron: Publish` to build your notes for publication and push your notes\n3. Your notes are now published privately behind a password\n\n## Workspace\n\n### Using Dendron with Github and Git\n\nOne of our users published a great beginners guide on this [here](https://mstempl.netlify.app/post/dendron-git/)\n\n### Adding a Remote Vault to your Dendron Workspace\n\nIf you haven't already done so, install Dendron and initialize a workspace by following the instructions [[here|dendron.guides.install]].\n\nUse the [[Vault Add|dendron.topic.commands#remote-vault]] command via the [[command palette|dendron.ref.terms#command-palette]], select remote vault, and paste the git url of the vault that you like to add\n\n### Converting a local vault to a remote vault\n\n1. If your vault is committed along with your workspace, use `git rm --cached` to remove it from the workspace repo and use `git init` to initialze your vault as a standalone repo\n1. Navigate to the root of your vault and initialize a git repository\n    ```sh\n    cd {vaultName}\n    git init\n    git add .\n    git commit -m \"initial commit\"\n    git add origin {your origin}\n    git push -u origin HEAD\n    ```\n1. Run [[Configure (yaml)|dendron.topic.commands#configure-yaml]] and add the git [[remote|dendron.topic.vaults#remote]] urls to the repo. the entries should look like what you see below\n\n![[dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.topic.vaults#^NiCCqLjTG2nbM6Qi:#*]]\n\n### Using Dendron with Code\n\nThe easiest current way to do this is to have multiple instances of VSCode open and toggle between the two. If you are very adventurous, you might even have [multiple versions of vscode](https://www.kevinslin.com/notes/7f197479-279e-4b1e-9edd-21bf2da423b0.html#dendron-setup) for different contexts.\n\nWe are working on being able to run Dendron without the need for a workspace. You can track the progress of this on this [issue](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/322)\n\n### Renaming a Vault\n\nWe currently haven't implemented a command to do but you can use the current manual steps to implement.\n\n1. Update the [[name|dendron.topic.config.dendron#name]] property in `dendron.yml`\n1. Update the name property on the corresponding [[workspace folders|dendron.topic.config.vscode-config#folders]]\n1. Replace any [[cross Vault Links|dendron.topic.links#cross-vault-links]] with the name of the new workspace\n\n-   ctrl search `dendron://{vaultName}` and replace it with the new vaultName\n\n1. Run `> Reload Window` when these steps are completed\n\n### Private Vaults\n\nYou can create private vaults that won't be published or initialized when others clone the workspace. To do this, run [[Vault Add|dendron.topic.commands#vault-add]] and add your private vault as a local vault. After it's been added, run [[Configure (yaml)|dendron.topic.commands#configure-yaml]] and set the [[visibility|dendron.topic.config.dendron#visibility]] of the vault to \"private\" in `dendron.yml`.\n\n```yml\nvaults:\n    - fsPath: vault\n      visibility: private\n```\n\n### Create note in a specific vault\n\nThere are multiple ways to create a note in a specific vault\n- open a note that is already in the vault (all vaults have a `root` note by default so thats a quick way to select a particular vault)\n- use the [[vaultSelectionMode|dendron.topic.lookup.modifiers#vaultselectionmode]] modifier on lookup to select a new vault on creation\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/401c5889-20ae-4b3a-8468-269def4b4865.html","relUrl":"notes/401c5889-20ae-4b3a-8468-269def4b4865.html"},{"doc":"Best Practices","title":"Best Practices","hpath":"dendron.guides.best-practices","content":"\n## Naming\n\nWe recommend using all lower [[kebab case|dendron.concepts#kebab-case]] when naming your files. For example, `awesome apples` would be `awesome-apples`. This would be stored in your file system as `awesome-apples.md`. \n\nDendron will auto-generate a human friendly title based on the last part of your hierarchy. By default, Dendron uses [title.sh](https://title.sh/) to generate titles based on your note name. Titles generated are consistent with the [Chicago Manual of Style](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html). Dendron will replace `-` with a ` ` when generating titles. \n\nIf you end up adding custom capitalization to your file name, Dendron will not attempt to generate a title but return the last part of your hierarchy as is.\n\nSome examples below:\n\n```\n- awesome-apples.md -> title: Awesome Apples\n- fruit.awesome-apples.md -> title: Awesome Apples\n- fruit.Custom-Capitalization -> title: Custom-Capitalization\n```\n\n## Using Dendron Across Machines\n\nThere are many ways to accomplish this and will differ based on your use case.\n\n### Synchronizing Everything in One Repo\n\nIn this setup, all your notes are synchronized in a single git repository. \n\n1. After you initialize your workspace, initialize a git repository of your entire workspace. \n\t```sh\n\tcd $workspace\n\tgit init\n\tgit add .\n\tgit commit -m \"initial commit\"\n\t```\n1. Create a remote git host (github is the most popular and probably easiest to setup) and push your changes there\n1. Clone the workspace on any machine you want to use Dendron in\n\n- NOTE: Dendron provides the [[Workspace: Sync|dendron.ref.workspace#workspace-sync]] command to make using a git based workflow easier to manage\n\n\n### Synchronizing Everything across Multiple Repos\n\nThis setup is most useful if you are using [[Multi Vault|dendron.topic.vaults.multi-vault]] or are planning on publishing to the [[Seed Bank|dendron.topic.seed-bank]].\n\nIn this setup, only your `dendron.yml` and other metadata files are comitted when you commit your workspace. Each [[vaults|dendron.topic.vaults]] will be hosted at its own github endpoint. \n\n1. After you initialize your workspace, initialize a git repository of everything except your vault\n\t```sh\n\tcd $workspace\n\tgit init\n\techo vault >> .gitignore\n\tgit add .\n\tgit commit -m \"initial commit\"\n\t```\n1. Convert your vault to a remote vault by following the instructions [[here|dendron.guides.cook#converting-a-local-vault-to-a-remote-vault]].\n1. Create a remote git host (github is the most popular and probably easiest to setup) and push your workspace changes there\n1. Clone the workspace on any computer you want to use Dendron on\n\n- NOTE: If you have non-public vaults, make sure each computer that you clone Dendron on has the necessary permissions to clone said vault. Instructions for doing this with github can be found [here](https://saas.dendron.so/notes/L80sFsAAcOO_0ztqZrN1J.html)\n\n\n\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/8d3c8142-7481-40da-9a5c-69a3d4bab697.html","relUrl":"notes/8d3c8142-7481-40da-9a5c-69a3d4bab697.html"},{"doc":"Features","title":"Features","hpath":"dendron.features","content":"\n## Hierarchies\n\nDendron proposes **hierarchies** as the **human solution** to information overload. This is because there are few things as effective as a multi-level hiearchy for quickly filtering an overwhelming amount of information to something humans can work with. You can read [this blog post](https://www.kevinslin.com/notes/e1455752-b052-4212-ac6e-cc054659f2bb.html) for the extended rationale behind this.\n\nIn Dendron, you can quickly **lookup** related notes by their hierarchy. Hierarchies are simply `.` delimited filenames, similar to the hierarchies made by domain names (eg. `github.com`).\n\nThe following are a few notes that have this hierarchical naming format.\n\n```\n- cli.tar.md\n- cli.tar.env.md\n- cli.curl.md\n- cli.dig.md\n```\n\n### Flexible structure\n\nWhereas notes can end up in a tangled mess when you only have backlinks and folders, Dendron has a flexible and emergent series of tools to help you structure your data. [[dendron.topic.hierarchies]] function as support beams, they help enforce the foundations of your knowledge base. Dendron encourages you to be flexible with your mental models by allowing you to [[refactor|dendron.topic.commands#refactor-hierarchy]] them. And once you've got a handle on a particular topic, [[schemas|dendron.topic.schema]] can help you scale out to other domains and see patterns that you otherwise wouldn't.\n\n## Lookup\n\n**Lookup** is the process of finding a note by traversing its hierarchy.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/lookup-cli.gif)\n\n> Lookups are **quick**\n\nWhat's nice about using the `.` delimited format is that a note **can be** both **a file** (something that contains data) and **a folder** (something that contains other files) **at the same time**.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/lookup-folder_and_file.gif)\n\n> You **can** be a file and have your folder **too**\n\nDendron uses fuzzy matching on paths so you don't have to type out the whole path.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/lookup-fuzzy.gif)\n\n> Lazyness is the key to success\n\nYou can use **lookup** to figure out what is true!\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/lookup-bool.gif)\n\n## Schemas\n\nIf you're paying close attention, you might have noticed some icons popup during lookup.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/schema-closeup.jpg)\n\nThese icons indicate the **schema** associated with the note. Think of schemas as an **optional type system** for your information. They describe the hierarchy of your notes and are themselves, represented as a hierarchy.\n\nYou can create a schema by adding a YAML file with the following naming scheme `{name}.schema.yml` to your workspace.\n\nBelow is an example of a three-level hierarchy describing cli commands. You don't need to concern yourself with the details of the schema syntax just yet, just know that this schema will match the following [glob patterns](https://facelessuser.github.io/wcmatch/glob/): `cli.*`, `cli.*.cmd`, `cli.*.cmd.*`, `cli.*.env`\n\n```yml\n- id: cli\n  desc: command line interface reference\n  parent: root\n  namespace: true\n  children:\n      - cmd\n      - env\n- id: env\n  desc: variables relevant for command\n- id: cmd\n  desc: subcommands\n  namespace: true\n```\n\nSchemas help you organize your notes by letting you know what comes next.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/schema-suggest.gif)\n\nThe `+` sign next to the suggestion indicates that the note does not exist but is part of the schema.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/schema-plus.jpg)\n\n**Schema suggestions** don't show you an endless lineup of tags or folders - they only show you suggestions scoped to your specific level of the hierarchy that you are looking at.\n\nThe nice thing about these suggestions is that you can also ignore them.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/schema-ignore.gif)\n\n> Sometimes ~~rules~~ schemas are meant to be broken\n\nDendron will show you a `?` next to the result in future results but otherwise will assume that you know best.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/schema-question.jpg)\n\n## VS Code\n\nDendron is built on top of VSCode, the open-source IDE from Microsoft.\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/code-banner.jpg)\n\nDendron runs as a plugin inside VSCode. If you use VSCode today, it means that all your current knowledge, settings and extensions will carry over into Dendron. If you don't, no sweat, because Dendron will create an optimal workspace with recommended settings and extensions when you first launch it.\n\n## Recommended Extensions\n\nSince Dendron runs on top of VSCode, it means that you also have access to thousands of extensions to customize Dendron exactly how you like it.\n\nBy default, Dendron will initialize your first workspace with the following extensions and features.\n\n-   [Markdown Notes](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kortina.vscode-markdown-notes)\n    -   [wiki links](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kortina.vscode-markdown-notes)\n    -   [tags](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kortina.vscode-markdown-notes)\n    -   [backlinks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kortina.vscode-markdown-notes) (think Roam)\n-   [Markdown Shortcuts](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mdickin.markdown-shortcuts)\n    -   Quickly toggle bullet points\n    -   Easily generate URLs\n    -   Convert tabular data to tables\n-   [Markdown Preview Enhanced](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced)\n    -   [live markdown preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced)\n    -   [math](https://shd101wyy.github.io/markdown-preview-enhanced/#/math) (KaTeX or MathJax)\n    -   [sequence diagrams](https://shd101wyy.github.io/markdown-preview-enhanced/#/diagrams?id=mermaid) (mermaid)\n    -   [pandoc support](https://shd101wyy.github.io/markdown-preview-enhanced/#/pandoc)\n    -   [code chunks](https://shd101wyy.github.io/markdown-preview-enhanced/#/code-chunk)\n    -   [presentations](https://rawgit.com/shd101wyy/markdown-preview-enhanced/master/docs/presentation-intro.html)\n-   [Material Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=equinusocio.vsc-material-theme)\n    -   beautiful colors built using the [Material design system](https://material.io/)\n-   [Paste Image](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mushan.vscode-paste-image)\n    -   easily add images from your clipboard to your markdown files\n-   [Spell Right](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ban.spellright)\n    -   Spell Check\n\n## Fast and performant\n\nDendron operates completely on local data and is able serve your notes to you without ever having to pull from a server. That means there's no downtime. We index your notes so [[dendron.topic.lookup]] is fast and everything (and I mean [[everything|dendron.topic.keybindings]]) has keyboard shortcuts so you never have to leave the home row.\n\n## Local-first\n\nDid we mention we're local first? We'll never send your notes off your system unless you want to explicitly. We also have easy guides for syncing with Github or you can always use your own service (Dropbox, Onedrive) to sync your notes wherever you want. Because you own your data.\n\n## Extensible and open-source\n\nDendron is built into VSCode and can take advantage of all the extensions you've come to love. Whether you want vim keybindings, mermaid diagram support or snippet support, the extension ecosystem has you covered. And if you can't find something that you need, we also offer [[dendron.topic.hooks]] so you can build advanced workflows, right into Dendron.\n\n## Additional Features\n\nThe following extensions also work well with Dendron but are not bundled by default. You can download them separately to unlock additional functionality.\n\n-   [Gitlens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens) 🔍\n    -   Repository/File/Line history and annotations of all your files\n-   [Vim](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim)\n    -   VIM key bindings 😍\n-   [Bookmarks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alefragnani.Bookmarks)\n    -   Bookmark lines within files\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/4bb85c39-d8ac-48ad-a765-3f2a071f7bc9.html","relUrl":"notes/4bb85c39-d8ac-48ad-a765-3f2a071f7bc9.html"},{"doc":"FAQ","title":"FAQ","hpath":"dendron.faq","content":"\nAll the questions we thought you might ask.\n\n## General\n\n### What is a Dendron?\n\nA Dendron is many things.\n\n1. Dendron is the greek word for tree. It's a reference to the hierarchal note taking that Dendron(3) enables.\n2. Dendron is another word for [dendrite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrite) which is an extension of the nerve cell that sends and receives signals in the brain. Think of Dendron(3) as a digital nervous system that helps you consolidate all the information that you care about in the fastest and most efficient way possible.\n   ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Neuron_Hand-tuned.svg/2880px-Neuron_Hand-tuned.svg.png)\n    - Image by Quasar Jarosz at English Wikipedia\n3. Dendron is a local-first, markdown based, hierarchical note taking tool. It is meant to help you organize, manage, publish, and collaborate on knowledge bases of any size.\n\n### How is Dendron different from X note taking tool?\n\nSubstitute X with `roam|obsidian|foam|one note|evernote|...`\n\nAll note taking tools (try to) make it easy to get notes in. It's getting it back out again that's hard, and it **becomes harder** as you get more notes.\n\nWhether you are using notebooks tags, or backlinks, once you have more than a few hundred notes, you'll need to have some sort of structure in place (eg. naming convention, hierarchy, etc.) to keep track of them.\n\nDendron is a highly opinionated note taking tool that focuses on **hierarchal note taking**. It provides the freedom of Roam's _every note exists everywhere philosophy_, while layering on top **flexible hierarchies** to keep track of it all.\n\nWhile Dendron works with knowledge bases of any size, it really shines once you've accumulated a few hundred notes. I created it to handle my personal knowledge base of 20k+ markdown notes — Dendron lets me track and find any specific note in it in seconds. You can read more about Dendron's hierarchal approach to note taking [here](https://www.kevinslin.com/notes/3dd58f62-fee5-4f93-b9f1-b0f0f59a9b64.html).\n\n### How is Dendron different from Roam?\n\nWhereas Roam is built around the idea of **bi-directional links** (and daily journals) which help you create notes without having to explicitly organize your notes, Dendron is built to help you organize notes without friction using **flexible hierarchies**.\n\nWe provide the tooling to create, enforce, and change these hierarchies at will. If you think of Roam as a graph database for notes, you can think of Dendron as Redis. To give you a sense of scale, Dendron is used to manage knowledge bases of +30K notes.\n\nSome additional features that set Dendron apart:\n\n-   Dendron allows you to compose your workspace with vaults (a vault is a collection of notes that can come from anywhere) from any number of sources\n-   Dendron is based on plain text (Dendron-flavored) markdown (exportable to regular markdown or any other format)\n-   Dendron is integrated into VSCode\n-   Dendron allows for easy publishing public/private content to any platform that can host a static site (and we're rolling out our own publishing platform to help people publish with additional access controls)\n\n### How does Dendron help me track my notes?\n\n1. Dendron organizes and collapse all your notes into managable chunks using [[hierarchies|dendron.topic.hierarchies]].\n2. Dendron helps you manage your hiearchies using [[schemas|dendron.topic.schema]]\n3. Dendron gets out of your way when you're working with your notes during [[lookup|dendron.topic.lookup]]\n\nDendron's secret sauce is that it provides the necessary tooling for you to work with hierarichal notes. While hierarchies have traditionally (and justifiably) gotten a bad reputation, I would argue that this is because the **tooling** around hierarchies were bad, not because hierarchies themselves are bad.\n\nHierarchies are one of the most effective ways that **both humans and computers** process large amount of information (there's a reason why almost every database is built from a variation of the [b-tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree)). You can find further details about hierarchies in this [blog post](https://www.kevinslin.com/notes/e1455752-b052-4212-ac6e-cc054659f2bb.html)\n\n### Is Dendron free? Will it stay free?\n\nDendron, the client, is free and will always remain free. It is also open source so anyone is free to make their own fork of Dendron.\n\nThat being said, I'm all in on Dendron and this is my full time gig. I want to make sure that developing Dendron remains sustainable. To that end, I plan on introducing value add server side functionality that folks may pay for. Examples of paid for features include:\n\n-   private hosting (for folks who want to publish but not use github pages or want to add authentication)\n-   enterprisy things\n    -   eg. on premise installations of Dendron with single sign on, active directory, and fine grained permissions\n-   offering private subscription based vaults (eg. think [substack](https://substack.com) but having people subscribe to vaults instead of newsletters )\n-   server side IFTTT like functionality (eg. everytime I add an entry to airtable, add a note to Dendron)\n\nPaid for features will be 100% optional and will not be necessary for any client side functionality in Dendron.\n\n### Why is Dendron built on top of VSCode?\n\nAs with all things, its a matter of tradeoffs. Dendron started its life as a standalone app (eg. think Obsidian) but I quickly realized I was spending most of my time building undifferentiated editor scaffolding instead of focusing on the hierarchies and schemas that made Dendron unique.\n\nI wanted to spend more time building out features that supported Dendron's [hiearchy first approach](https://www.kevinslin.com/notes/3dd58f62-fee5-4f93-b9f1-b0f0f59a9b64.html) to note taking which is what led me to re-write it for VSCode.\n\nThat being said, the core dendron engine is not vscode specific and there are folks that are experimenting with porting it over to other editors (eg. sublime, vim). We also have plans for a standalone editor in the future (most likely, this will be a fork of VSCode optimized for note taking)\n\n## Notes\n\n### Why markdown?\n\nMarkdown lets you write text in a simple human readable notation that is platform independent. You don't need to have microsoft word to read a markdown file and now a days, all new note taking tools support importing and displaying markdown.\n\nFor more context, you can see the original markdown declaration [here](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)\n\n### Can I use Dendron with existing notes?\n\nYou can use Dendron with existing repositories of markdown notes.\n\nOpen the `Command Palette` in vscode and use the `Dendron: Change Workspace` command. It will ask you for a folder path as input.\n\nDendron will create a `dendron.code-workspace` file in specified directory and then open the workspace (if a workspace file already exists, it will use that). It will also create a `root.md` file in that directory if it doesn't exist (currently this is part of the internal working of dendron).\n\nDendron **does not** delete or overwrite any files during the **Change Workspace** operation.\n\n### How do I save?\n\nDendron automatically saves when you change focus (switch tabs or applications). You can also manually save using `Cmd+S` or `Ctrl+S` depending on your operating system\n\n### How do I go back to the previous note?\n\nThere are 3 ways to go back to my previous note:\n\n1. `ctrl-tab` (go to previous tab)\n2. click on the previous tab\n3. using the open editors pane\n\n-   NOTE: to have more than a single tab show, you need to have the following settings\n\n```json\n{\n    \"workbench.editor.enablePreview\": false,\n    \"workbench.editor.showTabs\": true\n}\n```\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/faq.go-back.gif)\n\n### What can I do with the `root` note?\n\nThe root note is a special note that comes with every dendron vault. You can't rename it and we don't advise that you create a hierarchy from it. You can add custom frontmatter variables and change all existing variables except the `id` field. \n\nYou are also free to use the body however you wish. \n\n### Can I manually move notes?\n\nYes. You can move notes manually outside of Dendron or between different vaults. Some things to keep in mind:\n- you should keep the `id` of the note since features like publishing depend on it to find the right link\n- if your notes have [[Cross Vault Links|dendron.topic.links#cross-vault-links]] (only applicable for [[Multi Vault|dendron.topic.vaults.multi-vault]]), those links might bring if they are moved to a different workspace that doesn't have reference to the original vault\n\n## Hierarchies\n\n### How should I name a note?\n\nThere are no rigid requirements on note naming in Dendron, other than the dots in the file name are used to construct the [[note hierarchy|dendron.topic.hierarchies]]. However, the recommended way is to use all lowercase letters, replace spaces with `-`-mark and remove any special characters. Thus e.g. `John's amazing garage` becomes `johns-amazing-garage`.\n\nAlso, remember that you will use the note [[lookup-feature|dendron.topic.lookup]] to find notes quickly, and the lookup will use the names of the files. Thus try to name the files using the words that you are likely to use to find the note.\n\n### What kind of note hierarchy should I create?\n\nA good guideline is to start with a relatively flat hierarchy (even just a single note in the root!) and add topics as headings into those notes. When notes grow to the point that you have to start scrolling, it’s time to consider if it would be beneficial to split those notes. At that point, you probably already have some idea how the thoughts are placed in your mind - try to mimic that also with the hierarchy.\n\nIf you have a hard time deciding which ideas belong closer to root, think which of those ideas are more fundamental in your thinking. As an example, a note related to coding in Excel, should it be named as `code.excel` or `excel.code`? This could be resolved by thinking if you will write more about coding where Excel is just one example, or more about Excel, where coding is only one example. In case you think that both `excel.code` and `code.excel` are equal and both should be created, you could also make one of them a “master note” and [[refer|dendron.topic.references]] to it from the other note.\n\n### Do I have to use hierarchies? What if I want to use another approach?\n\nDespite our emphasis on hierarchies, Dendron also supports non-hierarchal ways of organizing notes (eg. backlinks, zettelkasten, etc).\n\nYou can, and are encouraged to, combine these other workflows with Dendron hierarchies in order to create your own workflow that takes the best parts of each system!\n\n### What if I have a note that belongs in multiple hierarchies?\n\nThis comes up a lot especially when your dealing with organizing collections of things, like music or books. There are a few approaches we recommend here.\n\n1. Use [[tags|dendron.topic.tags]]. Tags work best with categorical data. If you use **Dendron Tags** (aka they're really hierarchies), then you have the added advantage of being able to refactor and track your tags using Dendron's existing hierarchal tooling.\n2. Use alias nodes. This is an [upcoming feature](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/128) that will allow you to put a node under multiple hierarchies.\n\n### Hierarchies add too much friction\n\nThe hierarchy adds friction but the idea is that the friction (eg. hierarchy) is not a bug but the reason why dendron works with thousands of notes.\n\nThe analogy to think about is excel: while putting your numbers inside the structure of a spreadsheet might not be the most straightforward way of getting to a numerical solution, its use becomes indispensable once you deal with a significant amount of numbers.\n\nThe way to think about dendron is that its not like google where you type a question and try to find an answer - until we get true AI, this simply doesn't work for personal knowledge. Rather, Dendron helps you organize your notes so you can reference the information you need to answer your own questions.\n\n### Hierarchies are too rigid\n\nTraditional hierarchies are like straight jackets - they are confining and force you down a certain path once set. The hierarchies in Dendron are more like support beams - they help enforce the foundation of your knowledge base. Dendron encourages you to be flexible with your mental models (represented as hierarchies in Dendron) and change them over time. \n\nCurrent tools for Zettelkasten or Notes you can think of as a *one level hierarchy* that is strung together by links. Dendron provides that but also lets you go deeper by building out multi-level hierarchies when it is useful to do so. \n\n### Will Dendron ever support folders?\n\nIt is possible though most of the approaches we've thought of would take a large amount of effort and deliver questionable benefit on top of what's already planned (for more info, see the discussion [here](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/210)). \n\nIf you want the ability to collapse folders, you can use the [[dendron tree view|dendron.topic.workbench#dendron-tree-view]]. For existing folder based notes and assets, you can use the [[markdown pod|dendron.topic.pod.builtin.markdown.import]] to import them into Dendron.\n\nAt the end of the day, folders are meant to be an implementation detail for dendron. The underlying primitive of a note is an object that has metadata, content, and links. You can think of dendron as a flat file based database and lookup and the tree view as the UI to said database. For use cases involving external tools that require folders, you'll soon be able to use the [[markdown export pod|dendron.topic.pod.builtin.markdown.export]] to do just that.\n\n## Schemas\n\n### What is the deal with schemas? Do I need to use them?\n\nThe short answer is no, you don't **need** to use schemas. That being said, schemas can help you manage your notes, especially as you collect more of them.\n\nIf you're familiar with typescript - Dendron schemas are similar to the types offered by typescript. You can compile your typescript code into javascript even if the types don't match (subject to your tsconfig). Types help make your projects maintainable, especially as they grow.\n\nCurrently, Dendron will do is show you an indicator if your schema doesn't match. In the future, we'll have a strict mode where we will actually prevent you from creating notes that don't match your schema.\n\nSchemas at the end of the day help you construct consistent hierarchies for your notes. Consistent hierarchies alleviate the cognitive overhead of needing to understand and track N things where N can be very big. Instead, you can construct a single schema that encompasses the common areas of all N things.\n\nBut even if you don't have a lot of notes, schemas are helpful because they provide extra features [like templating](https://dendron.so/notes/c5e5adde-5459-409b-b34d-a0d75cbb1052.html#schema-templates) and [auto complete](https://dendron.so/notes/c5e5adde-5459-409b-b34d-a0d75cbb1052.html#why-use-schemas).\n\n### How do schemas work with multi-vault?\n\nThe short answer currently is *not very well* 😅\n- if two schemas overlap between different vaults, the last schema wins\n- schema imports don't currently work x-vault\n\nWhat this will be in the future:\n- schemas should only work on the vault that they are declared in, and you can have an option to specify (in `dendron.yml` if you want a schema to be global)\n- schema imports should work xvault (import syntax will be `{vaultName}.{schemaName}`)\n\n## Vaults\n\n### Git Doc and other extensions don't recognize my repos for multi-vault\n\nMany VSCode extensions that work across multiple git repositories won't recognize repos nested another repo. The way to fix this is by having your workspace be the last entry inside `folders` in your code workspace file (Dendron does this by default for new workspaces and if you add new vaults using `Vault Add`). You can see an example below. You can see a published example of this setup [here](https://github.com/kevinslin/kevin-garden)\n\n```json\n    \"folders\": [\n        ...\n        {\n            \"path\": \"kevin-public/vault\",\n            \"name\": \"kevin-public\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"path\": \"kevin-blog/vault\",\n            \"name\": \"kevin-blog\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"path\": \".\"\n        }\n    ],\n```\n\n## Humans\n\n### How do I share my notes with others?\n1. The *easiest* way to share public documents *for consumers* is to publish it as a site. Instructions [[here|dendron.topic.publishing.quickstart]]\n2. If folks are comfortable with markdown, you can use the markdown pod to export your entire workspace or just a specific page to markdown. Instructions [[here|dendron.topic.pod.builtin.markdown]]\n    - NOTE: this doesn't preserve backlinks or assets\n3. The full experience is committing your workspace as a git repo and having collaborators use Dendron to add it as a [[Remote Vault|dendron.topic.vaults#remote-vault]]\n\n\n\n## Pods\n\n### What are pods?\n\nPods are a means of data migration. You can import/export notes from other tools in and out of Dendron\n\nInternally for example, we use google docs to take meeting notes collaboratively and then we use the gdoc import pod to turn it into a dendron note\n\nYou can read more about them [[here|dendron.topic.pod]].\n\n## Publishing\n![[dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.topic.publishing.faq]]\n\n## Search and Filtering\n\n### Can I filter by the metadata in Dendron?\n\nMetadata is currently under utilized because we don't have a built in way of easily querying by it. We currently have [this issue](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/152) tracking the progress of advanced query work.\n\nIn the future, we want to support:\n\n-   querying by custom frontmatter attributes: <https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/152>\n-   query by attributes with logical operators: <https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/159>\n\nWe also want to support some subset of the queries as note references so that the results can be included in page.\n\nFor now, we recommend you use the [[search editor|dendron.guides.tips#search-editor]] capability for liimited querying capabilities.\n\n## Other\n\n\n### Can I autocomplete an hierarchy?\n\nSee this [issue](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/490).\n\nTLDR: vscode doesn't expose tab completion via API. There are two alternatives we're currently considering:\n\n-   overload the `enter` command, one press to autocomplete, two presses to select\n-   replace the lookup component with a webview\n\n\n### How to launch dendron with most recent vault quickly?\n\nIn menu bar of VSCode, select `File` -> `New Window` and click the Dendron workspace in Recent section of the Welcome tab.\n\n### Why are there `root` files in my notes?\n\nWhen you initialize a vault, `root.md` and `root.schema.yml` get created inside each vault.\n\nThey serve as the \"roots\" of your vault for your notes and schema respectively.\n\nroot.md is used as the parent of all hierarchies, root.schema as the parent of all schemas\n\nroot.md is what shows up when you do a lookup with an empty line \"\"\n\nroot.schema.yml is a schema that is global for all hierarchies (normally, a schema is scoped to a particular hierarchy)\n\nNow this isn't required per-say, we could just do away with **root** notes and stick strictly to hierarchies and this might be an option in the future but this is the reasoning at the current time\n\nps. root.schema.yml doesn't work right now as described in the sense that we haven't implemented global schemas yet\n\n\n### Is there a list of keyboard shortcuts I can see?\n\nDendron has a list of keyboard shortcuts that you can access using `Dendron: Show Help` command. Note that these only show the commands that come with the Dendron Plugin but not its bundled extensions. We currently have an open [issue](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/148) to list all shortcuts on one page.\n\n### Why are there '+' signs next to the notes in the Tree View?\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/faq.plus-sign.jpg)\n\nThe reason you see this is because Dendron will create [[stub|dendron.concepts#stubs]] notes when creating notes that have parents that don't exist. These notes are placeholders and will only be visible in the Dendron Tree View with a `+` sign next to the name. The reason we do stubs is because we don't want to litter your file system with empty files. Stubs are a compromise - they let you see the hierarchy of your newly created notes without forcing you to create intermediary files.\n\n### Why custom markdown preview instead of the VSC one?\n\nOur custom markdown preview gives us much more functionality then the vscode one -> eg. note references, checkboxes, etc.\n\nIn addition, the markdown preview that Dendron uses is platform agnostic (eg. it's also available on atom). This means that other editors could potentially adopt it as well.\n\n### VSCode Snippets are not working in Frontmatter\n\nThe default snippets are scoped to markdown. You can create [global snippets](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets#_create-your-own-snippets) file to have snippets that work across all languages.\n\n### The extension 'Dendron Markdown Preview Enhanced' took a very long time to complete its last operation\n\nThis is a known issue whenever we release a new version of the preview (mostly because its uncompressed javascript). Moving forward, we'll be removing the dependency on an external plugin and integrating Dendron's markdown features into vscode's native markdown preview in the near future.\n\n### I want to push all my note to my git repository periodically\n\nThis can be done with some extensions that are external to Dendron such as:\n\n1. [autogit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=zeitnergmbh.auto-git)\n2. [gitdoc](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsls-contrib.gitdoc)\n3. [text](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ivangabriele.vscode-git-add-and-commit)\n\nIt is also described in our [[tip|dendron.guides.tips#automate-git-tasks,1:#*]] note.\n\n\n### Dendron 11ty Package Version is Confusing\n\nDendron 11ty used to be published outside of the monorepo and started with 1.x version whereas the monorepo started with 0.x .\n\nAfter we synced, we synced 11ty versioning and brought it down to 0.x. every minor release, we also publish the 1.x version of the 11ty package to make it consistent but during patch releases, we just keep the 0.x numbering. \n\nIts a bit of a hack and something that should go away in July 2021, when we switch to NextJs based publishing. \n\n### VSCode is telling me I have to authorize Dendron to run some code\n\nVSCode recently introduced a feature called [**_workspace trust_**](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/workspace-trust), which lets you choose whether or not you trust a project folder in VSCode for automatic code execution.\n\nSince Dendron creates a workspace for your notes, VSCode is asking you if you trust the workspace Dendron just created for you.\n\nYou can choose not to trust the workspace and be in **_restricted mode_**.\n\nYou can still use all of Dendron's feature in restricted mode except [[hooks|dendron.topic.hooks]].\n\n### My firewall is asking if I wanted to open new ports when I use Dendron. Why is this?\n\nDendron has a client-server architecture.\n\nThe extension talks to a (local) express server for a lot of the features and this is why it's opening new ports.\n\n### How do I setup Dendron to work between multiple machines?\n\nSee [[Using Dendron Across Machines|dendron.guides.best-practices#using-dendron-across-machines]]","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/683740e3-70ce-4a47-a1f4-1f140e80b558.html","relUrl":"notes/683740e3-70ce-4a47-a1f4-1f140e80b558.html"},{"doc":"Archive","title":"Archive","hpath":"dendron.faq.archive","content":"\n## Summary\n\nThese are FAQ questions that are no longer relevant or rarely come up\n\n## Dendron Markdown Preview Enhanced\n\n### Can I use a dark theme for the markdown preview?\n\nYes.

Downgrading to npm v6 is the only known workaround:\n\n```sh\nnpm i -g npm@^6.14.11\n```\n\n## git\n\nMost of the Dendron developers use Mac or Linux, so the file endings and permissions are not the same.\nAfter you build Dendron, git will pick up a lot of file changes that don't actually exist [^diff].\n\nIn order to fix this (preferably do this before building Dendron):\n\n- Create a .gitattributes file in the root of the Dendron repo and add `* text=auto` [^lineendings]\n- run `git config --add core.filemode false` on the repo [^chmod]\n\nIf you are still seeing blank changes in git run:\n\n- `git add --renormalize .` [^diff] (yes there is a single dot at the end of the command.)\n\n## watch script\n\nDendron has a watch.sh script which will continuously compile all dependencies while you are developing. This is useful, but windows does not run shell scripts natively... \n\nThe easiest way to run shell scripts on Windows is to use git BASH[^git][^gitbash], which gets automatically installed, when you install git for windows. (It should also already be on your PATH.)\n\nOpen git BASH inside the Dendron repo and run the script:\n\n```sh\n./bootstrap/scripts/watch.sh\n```\n\n[^yarn-8555]: [\"Cannot create property 'module' on string '{\\\"module\\\":\\\"C:\\\\\\\\Users\\\\\\\\[USER]\\\\\\\\.npm-init.js\\\"}'\".](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/8555#issuecomment-788099208)\n[^diff]: [git status shows changed files but git diff doesn't](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14564946/git-status-shows-changed-files-but-git-diff-doesnt)\n[^lineendings]: [How to change line-ending settings](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10418975/how-to-change-line-ending-settings)\n[^chmod]: [How do I make git ignore file mode (chmod) changed?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1580596/how-do-i-make-git-ignore-file-mode-chmod-changes)\n[^git]: [git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/)\n[^gitbash]: [How to run shell scripts on Window](https://www.thewindowsclub.com/how-to-run-sh-or-shell-script-file-in-windows-10) See last comment\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/d0f34b08-0725-4ec5-a600-a4d6309bb2ae.html","relUrl":"notes/d0f34b08-0725-4ec5-a600-a4d6309bb2ae.html"},{"doc":"Troubleshooting","title":"Troubleshooting","hpath":"dendron.dev.troubleshooting","content":"\n\n## Common Issues\n\n### Relative import to an inter-workspace dependency\n\nBecause Dendron is setup as a [yarn Workspace](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/), inter-workspace dependencies are all [hoisted](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/blob/main/doc/hoist.md) to the root.\n\n```\n.\n└── dendron\n    ├── packages\n    │   ├── A/\n    │   ├── B/\n    │   └── ...\n    └── node_modules\n```\n\nThis is to de-duplicate packages during development. When publishing to `npm`, every package will have its own `node_modules` folder. The consequence of this setup is that it is possible for package `A` to have a relative dependency on package `B`. While valid during development, this would fail when published. \n\nWhat's worse is that VSCode intellisense will often autocomplete with the relative import\n\n```ts\n// bad\nimport { createLogger } from \"../../A/lib\";\n\n// good\nimport { createLogger } from \"A\";\n```\n\nTo fix this, convert instances of the **bad** example to the **good** one.\n\n\n## Common Fixes\n\n### Remove the `lib` folder\n\nAfter a major refactor, you might need to clean out the `lib` folder.

Triaging an issue usually takes around one business day but may take longer, for example, when there's a large incoming rate or the area owners are not available. The goal of triaging is to provide you with a clear understanding of what will happen to your issue. For example, after your feature request was triaged you know whether we plan to tackle the issue or whether we'll wait to hear what the broader community thinks about this request.\n\nFrom your perspective it's straightforward to understand whether or not your issue is triaged:\n\n1. If the issue is labeled `status.triage-needed` ([query](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/labels/status.triage-needed)) it still needs to be triaged.\n2. If not, the issue is considered triaged.\n\nIf you feel like there's ambiguity on a particular issue in our backlog, please mark it with status.triage-needed and leave a comment with details to help the maintainers out.\n\n## Our Triaging Flow\n\nAn issue has three major states. They are easily identifiable:\n\n| State                   | What your GitHub issue looks like                        |\n| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Closed                  | matches the query `is:closed`                            |\n| Pending Community Input | Has a `status.help-wanted` or `status.info-needed` label |\n| Accepted                | Has a milestone assigned (that's not `Backlog`)          |\n\n## Closing Issues\n\nWe close issues for the following reasons:\n\n| Reason                                               | Label                |\n| ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |\n| The issue is obsolete or already fixed.              |                      |\n| We didn't get the information we need within 7 days. | `status.info-needed` |\n| It's a duplicate of another issue.                   | `status.duplicate`   |\n| What is described is the designed behavior.          | `status.by-design`   |\n| The issue is tracked in a repository we rely on.     | `status.upstream`    |\n\nWe close issues by assigning a label, adding a comment and closing the issue.\n\n## Requesting Information\n\nIf an issue misses information that we need to understand the issue, we assign the `status.info-needed` label.\n\n[This bot](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/.github/no-response.yml) is monitoring all issues labeled `status.info-needed`. If we don't receive the needed information within 7 days the bot closes the issue.\n\n## Categorizing Issues\n\nEach issue must have a **type** label.\n\n| Type                                                                          | Description                                                            |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [`bug`](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/labels/type.bug)                 | the implementation of a feature is not correct                         |\n| [`enhancement`](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/labels/type.enhancement) | Extension to a previously shipped feature. Minor functionality update. |\n| [`feature`](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/labels/type.feature)         | New functionality                                                      |\n| [`epic`](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/labels/type.epic)               | Umbrella issues representing significant customer impact               |\n|                                                                               |\n\n## Assigning Feature Areas\n\nEach issue will also have an **area** label, each representing a stage in the customer journey. This is also loosely how we choose to work on backlog issues.\n\n-   area.onboard\n-   area.create\n-   area.retrieve\n-   area.structure\n-   area.publish\n\n## Assigning a Milestone\n\nIn addition to [milestones](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/milestones) representing our weekly iterations and releases such as **`v42`** (representing the release of Dendron version 0.42.0 ), we have two milestones with special meaning:\n\n-   Issues assigned to **`Backlog`**: Our team is in favor of implementing the feature request/fix the issue. The issue is not yet assigned to a concrete iteration. If and when a Backlog item is scheduled for a concrete iteration depends on how well the issue aligns with our **[[roadmap|dendron.roadmap]]**. We review and update our roadmap at least every quarter. The Backlog helps us shaping our Roadmap but it is not the only source of input. Therefore, some Backlog items will be closed once it becomes clear that they do not align with our Roadmap.\n-   Issues assigned to **`Up Next`**: Our team wants to implement the feature/fix the issue. The issue is on the short list to be assigned to a concrete iteration. Note: **`Up Next`** is used sparsely. More commonly, issues go from **`Backlog`** or Triage directly to concrete iterations.\n\n## Asking for Help\n\nWe label **`Backlog`**issues, particularly feature requests, that we encourage the community to take up with `status.help-wanted`. If issues are suitable for beginners we may add the `size.small` label and add code pointers that help beginners to get started with a PR.\n\nPlease note, we will primarily accept PRs for issues that are accepted, i.e. have a milestone assigned (including `Backlog`).\n\n## Type-specific Characteristics / Triaging\n\n### Managing Feature Requests\n\nFeature requests like all issues are a means of communication between all of us as members of the Dendron community. Thus, in principle, we could keep all feature requests open no matter what will happen to the feature they describe. Unfortunately, this makes it hard to understand what has a realistic chance to ever make it into the repository. We therefore close feature requests we cannot address while we assign feature requests we don't plan to address in the near-future to the **`Backlog`** milestone.\n\nIf you are the author of a feature request you might not like that we close or don't plan to address your request asap. But, be assured, we love all of your input. Please don't take personal offense when we close or assign the **`Backlog`/`status.help-wanted`** milestone to your issue :peace_symbol:. If you feel your feature request deserves to stay open, improve your use case and ping us or gather more up-votes (our community [in Discord](https://discord.gg/xrKTUStHNZ) is a good source of our prioritization).\n\n### Up-voting a Feature Request\n\nWhen we refer to \"up-voting\" a feature request, we specifically mean adding a GitHub `+1`/\"👍\" reaction to the issue description. In the GitHub UI this looks like so:\n<img width=\"867\" alt=\"GitHub UI for a issue with a +1 reaction\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8586769/87996982-b0568c80-caa8-11ea-87b8-a01371e6e338.png\">\n\n## Community Request On Planning (CROP for short)\n![[dendron.community.crop]]\n\n## [Lookup](https://handbook.dendron.so/notes/b89ba854-72fb-4ebc-a8a0-55960b89e9dc.html#lookup)\n\nThis section is both inspired by and borrows heavily from the following project:\n\n-   [vscode triage process](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Issues-Triaging)\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/06751374-7982-4df2-b30b-92b10aba733a.html","relUrl":"notes/06751374-7982-4df2-b30b-92b10aba733a.html"},{"doc":"Bots","title":"Bots","hpath":"dendron.dev.triage.bots","content":"\nIn order for us to maintain triage hygiene, we've enabled bots in the Dendron repos.\n\n## No Response Bot\n\nSometimes an issue gets filed that needs more information just to be actionable by our repo maintainers.

Reduce code - code that is not duplicated \n\n## Conventiions\n\n### prefer using camelCase for variables\n\n```ts\n// good\nconst camelCaseIsPreferred = true\n\n// bad\nconst CamelCaseIsPreferred = false\n```\n\n### prefer returning objects instead of tuples\n\nThis make it easier to update return signatures and makes it explicit what is being returned\n\n```ts\n// good\nconst {fooValue, fooError} = foo()\n\n// bad\nconst [fooValue, fooError] = foo()\n```\n\n### prefer [is, does, has, should] prefixes for boolean usages.\n\nThis makes it clear that a given variable is a boolean. And communicates finality of expression.\n\n```ts\n// good\nconst isFriendly = isFriendly({person});\n\n// bad\nconst friendly = friendly({person});\n\n// could be improved. \n// \n// does NOT read as finalized value since maybeFriendly=true logically \n// still reads as 'maybe' while we want to communicate that it is in \n// fact friendly.\nconst maybeFriendly  = maybeFriendly({person});\n```\n\n## Typescript\n\n### prefer using `type` over `interface`\n\n- types and interfaces are mostly interchangable, `types` are a bit more flexible and so we've standardized on using it\n- see official typescript docs [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#differences-between-type-aliases-and-interfaces)\n\n```ts\n// good\ntype Foo {\n\n}\n\n// bad\ninterface Foo {\n}\n\n```\n\n### avoid using `@ts-ignore`\n\nUnless there is a special circumstance, avoid using this statement since it skips typechecking. Alternatives to some common use cases:\n- unused variables: prefix the variable with a `_`  (eg. `_foo`) to have typescript ignore it\n\n### prefer using `async/await` and `Promises` over callbacks\n\nMakes code more readable\n\n### prefer using object notation for methods ith multiple arguments\n\nThis makes code easier to refactor\n\n```ts\n// good\nfunction foo(opts: {arg1: string, arg2: string}) {\n\n}\n// bad\nfunction foo(arg1: string, arg2: string) {\n}\n```\n\n### prefer `undefined` and `null` over implicitly incorrect values\n\nType checking can warn you about a potentially undefined value, but not a value that's just implied to be undefined like `\"\"` or `-1`.\n\n```ts\n//good\nfunction findSomething(...) {\n  if (...) return 4;\n  return undefined; // not found!\n}\n// bad\nfunction findSomething(...) {\n  if (...) return 4;\n  return -1; // not found!\n}\n```\n\n### prefer compile time checks for exhaustive patterns\n\nIf you have a `switch` or a chain of `if ... else if` statements where you check all possible cases, add a static assertion so that if a revision breaks this in the future it will be easily caught.\n\n```ts\nimport { assertUnreachable } from \"@dendronhq/common-all\";\n\ntype MyOptions = \"one\" | \"two\";\n\n// bad\nfunction myFunction(var: MyOptions) {\n  if (var === \"one\") {/* ... */}\n  else {/* ... */}\n}\n\n// good\nfunction myFunction(var: MyOptions) {\n  if (var === \"one\") {/* ... */}\n  else if (var === \"two\") {/* ... */}\n  else assertUnreachable(var);\n}\n```\n\nThis works with properties within objects (e.g. `node.type`) too! One hint is that if the type of the object shows up as `never` in the editor, then you can use this assertion.\n\n### prefer `forEach` when iterating through an array\n\nThis is more concise and avoids some [unexpected behaviors](https://thecodebarbarian.com/for-vs-for-each-vs-for-in-vs-for-of-in-javascript.html) that can arise from other methods of iteration.\n\n```ts\n// good\n[1,2,3].forEach(elem => console.log(elem))\n\n```\n\n## Regular Expressions\n\n### Prefer negated sets\n\n`\\w` matches ASCII alphanumeric characters only, this means any unicode characters will not match.\n\n```js\n> \"oo\".match(/[\\w]+/)\n[ 'oo', index: 0, input: 'oo', groups: undefined ]\n> \"öö\".match(/[\\w]+/)\nnull\n```\n\nAs a result, describing the set of characters that should match is practically impossible if you want unicode characters to match as well. Instead, use a negated set to describe which should not match.\n\n```js\n> \"öö\".match(/[^\\s]+/)\n[ 'öö', index: 0, input: 'öö', groups: undefined ]\n```\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/773e0b5a-510f-4c21-acf4-2d1ab3ed741e.html","relUrl":"notes/773e0b5a-510f-4c21-acf4-2d1ab3ed741e.html"},{"doc":"Config","title":"Config","hpath":"dendron.dev.style.config","content":"\n## Summary\n\nThis page covers conventions and rules for organizing the configuration space.  \n\n## Conventions\n1. Name configurations that change something to behave in a certain way in a _transitive verb_ form.\n    - (verb) + (noun)\n    - e.g.)\n      - good: \n        ```js\n        enableMermaid: true,\n        ```\n      - bad:\n        ```js\n        mermaid: true,\n        ```\n1. Be conservative and consistent about the choice of verb in the configuration names that are in the transitive verb form.\n    - `enable` and `use` (or anything else) are both fine, but keep it consistent. Try to follow other namespace's choice as much as possible.\n    - e.g.)\n      - good:\n        ```js\n        ...\n        enableMermaid: true,\n        enableKatex: false,\n        enableNunjucks: false,\n        ...\n        ```\n      - bad:\n        ```js\n        enableMermaid: true,\n        useKatex: false,\n        activateNunjucks: false,\n        ```\n1. Use bare nouns only for configuration keys with values that are direct objects / literals.\n    - list of vaults, for example.\n1. Use only positive forms for boolean configuration names.\n    - good: \n      ```js\n      enableTelemetry: true,\n      ```\n    - bad: \n      ```js\n      noTelemetry: true,\n      ```\n1. Boolean configuration values should be required in the type definition.\n    - This is to explicitly and clearly state in the configuration what the default value is.\n      - It is either true or false. Even when optional, a default value is set down the line where the value is actually used. This makes it confusing to figure out what's happening unless you are familiar with the codebase.\n    - Prefer this over making it an optional property and assuming a default value in the place this config is being used.\n1. Configurations with values that are literals can be optional, but it is preferrable to explicitly set a sensible default value unless it is absolutely necessary to omit it to enable some kind of behavior.\n    - Similar to boolean config values, if you are setting an assumed default value where the config is used, it is better to set it explicitly required in the config definition itself.\n\n## Heuristics on when to create a new namespace\n- It is unclear what is the best way to group logically similar configurations. Use the rule of thumbs below with your best judgement when creating new namespaces.\n- If you anticipate that a lot of enhancement will be made to a particular area of the codebase, consider pre-emptively giving it a general namespace.\n- If some area of the codebase is considerably stable and you do not anticipate it changing any time sooner, consider giving it a suitable namespace.\n- If there are a handful (4-5) of singles that can be grouped into a namespace, consider grouping them into a namespace.\n- Regardless of the above points, create a separate namespace if you are adding a new configuration for a _command_.\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/7XSSCIpMNX2SFbKc6S0RB.html","relUrl":"notes/7XSSCIpMNX2SFbKc6S0RB.html"},{"doc":"Setup Dendron Development Environment","title":"Setup Dendron Development Environment","hpath":"dendron.dev.setup","content":"\n## Build\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nBefore you begin, you need to make sure to have the following SDKs and tools:\n\n- [Node.js >= 12.0.0](https://nodejs.org/download/release/latest-v10.x/)\n  - We recommend using a version in [Active LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/)\n- yarn\n  - `npm install -g yarn`\n- lerna\n  - `npm install -g lerna`\n- a different instance of VSCode\n  - because debugging VSCode by default loads up all extensions that are installed, you'll have issues trying to develop Dendron if you also have VSCode installed . the workaround is to install an alternative flavor of vscode (eg. [insider edition](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/)) to use for development \n\n### Steps\n\n1. Clone ^clone\n  ```bash\n  git clone https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron.git\n  cd dendron\n  ```\n\n1. Install dependencies\n  ```bash\n  # this should install all dependencies\n  yarn setup\n\n  # if the above script errors out, you can diagnose the issue and run the following scripts sequentially dependeing on where the error occured\n  yarn # install package root dependencies\n  yarn bootstrap:bootstrap # install package dependencise\n  yarn bootstrap:build  # build package dependencies\n  ```\n## Run\n\n1. Open the workspace.  At the root of the monorepo, open `dendron-main.code-workspace`. Open this with VSCode to start editing. While its not required to use VSCode, most of the helper scripts in this repository are created with VSCode in mind so using it will make development significantly easier.\n2. Debug\n  - NOTE: you don't need to do this if you are not directly working on the extension (eg. you're working on the [[server|pkg.dendron-next-server]])\n\nTo start an instance of the Dendron with the Debugger, Run `Extension: Local (plugin-core)` from the debug panel in vscode\n\n![debugger](/assets/images/start_debugger.gif)\n\n_Note: Running via Run -> Start Debugging will not work unless you've previously targeted `Extension: Local (plugin-core)`_\n\n_Note: To have the changes reflected as you edit the code you need to run the `./bootstrap/scripts/watch.sh` and restart the `Extension: Local (plugin-core)`)_\n\n## Remote Development \n\nIf you are developing Dendron in a remote environment using VSCode, see additional instructions [[here|dendron.dev.remote]].\n\n\n## Normal Workflow\n\n1. Checkout a feature branch for your task\n1. Work on code\n1. Submit a [[pull Request|dendron.dev.pull-request]] \n\n## Logging\n\nLogs are important for debugging and we should strive to have logs that will give enough information that we can debug any errors from the logs alone. Because we're dealing with users personal notes, we also need to ensure not to log any sensitive information.\n\nIf you need to log data, use one of the following loggers depending on what package you are in:\n- plugin-core: use [Logger](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/plugin-core/src/logger.ts#L22:L22)\n- react component: use [createLogger](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/common-frontend/src/utils/logger.ts#L3:L3) in common-frontend\n- everything else: use [createLogger](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/common-server/src/logger.ts#L36:L36) in common-server\n\nAlso note that many objects (eg. commands, pods, etc), have an instance of the logger attached to them. You should use them whenever available. They are usually attached as a `.L` or `.logger` property. \n- pods have loggers attached in `this.L`\n\nSome things to keep in mind:\n  - Do not use `console.log` to log data\n  - Raw note objects contain note content which we never want to log. Instead, use [`NoteUtils.toLogObj`](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/common-all/src/dnode.ts) which strips out sensitive fields to the logger. \n\n## Exceptions\n\nWhen handling a Dendron specific error, use the [DendronError](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/common-all/src/error.ts) class\n\nSome things to keep in mind:\n  - when returning an error from the server, note that you'll need to convert the error to a plain object using [error2PlainObject](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/common-all/src/error.ts#L110)\n  - when displaying an error in a string, you'll need to convert the error using [stringifyError](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/common-all/src/error.ts#L106:L106)\n  - whenever possible, attach a [status](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/common-all/src/constants.ts#L18:L18) to an error\n  - whenever possible, attach a [severity](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/common-all/src/constants.ts#L45) to an error\n\n## Project Specific Docs\n### Working with the API Server\n\nDendron connects to a local express server which is responsible for indexing your notes. This express server also serves up static files generated by [[Dendron Next Server|pkg.dendron-next-server]]. \n\nDendron compiles the static assets from the next server to the express server during publication so that everything is bundled when published. When you are developing, you can launch the next server independently for faster development. You can follow the instructions [[here|pkg.dendron-next-server.quickstart]] to start the next-server.\n\nTo start Dendron with the next server active, you can set the following value in `dendron.yml`\n\n```yml\ndev:\n  nextServerUrl: \"http://localhost:3000\"\n```\n\n### Working with the CLI\n\nSymlink `dendron` \n\n```sh\ncd packages/dendorn-cli\nnpm link\n\nnpm link -g @dendronhq/dendron-cli\n```\n\n## Advanced\n\n### Verdaccio\n\n![[dendron.dev.cook.common#verdaccio,1:#*]]\n\n### Linking all Packages\n\nThis goes over symlinking all packages locally. This requires that the `meta.json` file be generated. It is created as part of `yarn lerna:bootstrap`.\n\n```sh\nnode bootstrap/scripts/linkAll.js\n```\n\n## Tips\n\n### Watch Monorepo\n\nTo continuously compile all dependencies, run the following\n\n```bash\n./bootstrap/scripts/watch.sh\n```\n\n### Adding dependencies\n\nWhen you are merging new changes, note that new dependencies and sometimes packages will be installed. \n\n#### New Dependencies\n```sh\n# install all new dependencies\nlerna bootstrap\n```\n\n#### New Package in Dendron Mono Repo\nAdding new packages is a rarer event but might require a workspace rebuild\n\n```sh\n# clean up old files (this might take a few minutes)\n./bootstrap/scripts/cleanup.sh\n\n# install all dependencies\nlerna bootstrap\n\n# build all dependencies\n./bootstrap/scripts/build.sh\n```\n\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Something went wrong during the build\n\nIn case something something goes wrong with a build step or you want to save time by not running everything, `init.sh` is just a thin wrapper around the following scripts, each of which can be run individually\n\n- ./bootstrap/scripts/bootstrap.sh: `lerna bootstrap all packages`\n- ./bootstrap/scripts/build.sh: `lerna build all packages`\n\n### Changes not showing up in Dendron\n\n1. Are you using the `Run extension` command on the debugger panel to test dendron? \n\n2. If you have one vscode instance which you have dendron installed and are also doing dendron development on, you might get a version conflict. in that case, use `Run extension with plugin disabled` in the debugger panel (or use a different version of vscode to run dendron vs develop)\n\n### Husky Hooks not running\n\nMake sure you run `yarn` at the root of your workspace \n\n## Getting Help\n\nDendron is actively being developed and it could be quite confusing to start developing for the first time. In this case, we recommend asking for help with whatever blockers you might have with setting up or understanding part of the codebase.\n\nGenerally, a member of the Dendron team or the community will chime in for help if you post a specific question in the `#dev` channel in our Discord server.\n\nFor more information, check out our handbook entry on `Getting help for development` described [here](https://handbook.dendron.so/notes/bHWjVTtdOCMMRd2_QD0tb.html)\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/64f0e2d5-2c83-43df-9144-40f2c68935aa.html","relUrl":"notes/64f0e2d5-2c83-43df-9144-40f2c68935aa.html"},{"doc":"Remote","title":"Remote","hpath":"dendron.dev.remote","content":"\n\n## Summary\n\nWhen developing in VSCode, you can use its [remote development](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh) to ssh into another machine but keep VSCode as your development frontend.\n\nWhile installation intsructions are the same, there are some differences when running and testing code which are documented here.\n\n## Developing\n\n### Running Plugin Remotely\n\nUse the `Run Extension:Remote` launch task to start the extension. \n\n## QA\n\n### Running All Plugin Tests\n\nThis works the same as in local development\n\n### Running a single Plugin Test\n\nYou'll need to update the following file `src/test/suite-integ/index.ts`.

Open a test inside 'src/test/suite-integ/' from `plugin-core`\n2. Run the build task `Extension Integ Tests - File` \n\n### Run a specific test from non-dendron plugin package\n\n1. Go to file\n2. Use command prompt and run `> Tasks: Run tasks`\n3. Find the appropriate package and run `> npm:test:watch engine-test-utils`\n  - NOTE: most tests are consolidated in `engine-test-utils`. you can find them in `engine-test-utils/src/__tests__`\n\n## Writing Tests\n\nAll packages have tests written in `jest` except plugin-core. these tests use `mocha` assertion because vscode has a special test harness built around `mocha`  \n\n### Plugin Tests\n\n- NOTE: mocha will mark a test as a success if you return a promise. This is why we use callback style version of the tests\n\n```ts\n// good\ndescribe(\"foo\", function() {\n  test(\"does foo\", function(done) {\n    ...\n    done();\n  });\n});\n\n// bad\ndescribe(\"foo\", function() {\n  test(\"does foo\", async function( ) {\n    ...\n  });\n});\n```\n\nYou can see an example of a test [here](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/plugin-core/src/commands/CopyNoteURL.ts)\n\nAlso, consider enabling \"Uncaught Exceptions\" under \"Breakpoints\" when running tests. Otherwise, if you forget to `await` a function that returns a promise and that function throws an exception, the test will appear to pass even though an exception was thrown.\n\n### Test Workspace\n\n![[dendron.dev.ref.test-workspace]]\n\n### Stubs\nWe use [sinonjs](https://sinonjs.org/) to stub test methods. \n\nIf you use sinon, don't forget to call `sinon.restore` so that stubs don't leak into subsequent tests.\n\nWhen stubbing tests in the plugin, we following the following pattern\n```ts\nsuite(\"some test\", function() {\n  let ctx: vscode.ExtensionContext;\n  ctx = setupBeforeAfter(this, {\n    afterHook: () => {\n      sinon.restore();\n    },\n  });\n\n  it(\"test\", (done) => {\n    sinon.stub(...);\n    done();\n  });\n\n})\n```\n\nWhen stubbing test any other code, add an `afterEach` block.\n```ts\nafterEach(()=> {\n  sinon.restore()\n});\n```\n\n### Stubbing Mutating Disk Changes\n\nDendron has certain features that writes to locations that are global to all Dendron installations (`eg. ~/.dendron`). Because we run integration tests on these features, we also don't want these tests to overwrite our actual dendron setup. The tests for these sort of features should be stubbed.\n\nFor example, below is an example of stubbing the home directory for tests:\n\n```ts\nstatic mockHomeDir(dir?: string): SinonStub {\n  if (_.isUndefined(dir)) dir = tmpDir().name;\n  return sinon.stub(os, \"homedir\").returns(dir);\n}\n```\n\n## Reference\n\n### setupBasic\n- vault1\n  - foo\n  - foo.ch1\n  - bar\n\n\n### setupBasicMulti\n\n- vault1\n  - foo\n  - foo.ch1\n- vault2\n  - bar\n\n\n\n## Cook\n\n### Stubbing dendron.yml in a test\n![[pkg.engine-test-utils.cook#stubbing-dendronyml-in-a-test]]\n\n### Creating a mock note\n\nsee [this](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/16b0e5c59e3ee11530199b5c9a11a58f05e14a93/packages/common-test-utils/src/noteUtils.ts#L63-L63)\n\n### Updating test snapshots\n\nWe make frequent use of jest [snapshots](https://jestjs.io/docs/snapshot-testing) in our testing. These snapshots will fail the test if the output of a command changes. If you intend to change the output, run the following command:\n\n1. Use command prompt and run `> Tasks: Run tasks`\n2.

Furthermore, some API's differ in using a lower-case vs upper-case for the drive prefix; i.e. c:\\ vs C:\\. Always do case-insensitive string comparisons when doing file path checks. Solve these issues by using the `path` API when joining paths and always do case-insensitive checks.  \n\n  Bad:\n  ```typescript\n  expect(actualPath).toEqual(\n  \"root/vault/beta.md\")\n  );\n  ```\n  \n  Good:\n  ```typescript\n  expect(actualPath.toLowerCase()).toEqual(\n    path.join(\"root\", \"vault\", \"beta.md\").toLowerCase()\n  );\n  ```\n2. Tests that execute some code where a command-line executable is run (for example, Git operations via `execa`). On Windows, these commands will run under a cmd shell instead of a bash shell and may interpret argument syntax differently.  \n\nFor reference, take a look at a few example PR's below that fix issues similar to the ones mentioned above. \n- https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/pull/980\n- https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/pull/1011\n\n\n### Skipping Windows Test (Last Resort)\n\nIf a test continues to fail despite trying the methods listed above, the test may be skipped using the following test runner for the plugin: [runTestButSkipForWindows](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/plugin-core/src/test/testUtilsV3.ts)\n\n## Troubleshooting Windows CI Failures on Github Actions\n\nThe github actions CI test pass for windows can be finicky and there are sometimes issues there that don't show up locally. If you are debugging a github actions windows integration test issue and need to actually run the integration test using github action, we have a specific workflow [here](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/.github/workflows/ci-windows-test.yml#L1:L1) that triggers when you push to a branch matching the following pattern: `chore/windows-ci-*`\n\nThis is an example of a [pull request](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/pull/1060) that makes use of this","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/ydvcBHDK9gcghuHX.html","relUrl":"notes/ydvcBHDK9gcghuHX.html"},{"doc":"Verdaccio","title":"Verdaccio","hpath":"dendron.dev.qa.verdaccio","content":"\n## Summary\n\nWe use [verdaccio](https://verdaccio.org/), a \"A lightweight open source private npm proxy registry\", to test publishing locally. \n\n## Setup\n\n1.

Instead, I manually insert a `debugger` statement and vscode will break. Don't forget to remove the `debugger` statement \n\n### Non Plugin Code\n\nTo test non-plugin code, run the `debug one test (engine-test-utils)` task while having the test file open. Note that breakpoints won't break a lot of the times so if the test isn't breaking, manually add a `debugger` statement in the code. \n\n\n### Git Related Tests\n\nAny tests that involve setting up git should use [GitTestUtils](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/engine-test-utils/src/utils/git.ts). This will help you create a git workspace with necessary commit history. \n\nYou can see it being used [here](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/engine-test-utils/src/__tests__/engine-server/workspace.spec.ts).\n\nIf a tests involve a remote git repository, use `tmpDir` to setup a *local remote*. Use `GitTestUtils` to create a repo and then push an dpull to the local remote.\n\n### Engine Test\n\n- pre-req:\n  - read over the overall [[design|dendron.dev.design#overview]] for Dendron \n\nTesting the engine in Dendron involves a little bit of setup because:\n\n- it requires initializing the engine and seeding it with the right fixture for the test\n- it might require the same functionality be tested in multiple environments (plugin, CLI, server, engine, etc)\n- it might require using multiple test runners (dendron uses `jest` for all tests except for the [[dendron plugin|dendron.dev.design#dendron-plugin]] which uses [[mocha|pkg.dendron-plugin.qa#test-runner]])\n\nBecause of the aforementioned issues, we've created the following two classes to make testing easier and re-usable across environments.\n\n#### runEngineTest\n\n- setup a mock dendron environment\n\n- initialize the dendron engine\n\n- optionally seed engine with a preset\n\n- NOTE: there are currently multiple versions of this which track multiple generations of engine design\n  - the most current version is `runEngineTestV5`\n  - see example of usage [here](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/engine-test-utils/src/__tests__/site.spec.ts#L84:L84)\n\n#### TestPresetEntry\n\n- [code](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/common-test-utils/src/utilsv2.ts#L48:L48)\n\n- this helps us create a `TestPreset` which is to be used with `runEngineTest`\n\n- lets you add different lifecycle hooks as the engine is beign initialized\n\n- NOTE: there are currently multiple versions of this\n  - the most current version is `TestPresetEntryV4`\n\n\n## Profiling\n\nTo profile code, we use the following pattern\n\n```ts\nlet ctx = \"Some Context\"\nlet duration;\nconst start = process.hrtime();\n// ... some event to duration\nduration = getDurationMilliseconds(start);\nLogger.info({ctx, duration})\nAnalyticsUtils.track(VSCodeEvents.Lookup_Show, {\n  duration,\n  flavor: opts.flavor,\n});\n```\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/yhpcSlIpwsBX2iHjfyutP.html","relUrl":"notes/yhpcSlIpwsBX2iHjfyutP.html"},{"doc":"Build Repo","title":"Build Repo","hpath":"dendron.dev.qa.build-repo","content":"\n## Summary\n\nIn order to build Dendron locally, we need to have a second copy of Dendron checked out in the same monorepo to use with [[Verdaccio|dendron.dev.qa.verdaccio]]\n\n## Setup\n\n1.

All executing code paths should report error data in the event of crashes or any error event that is not a direct result of invalid input. For example in the context of HTTP, all `500 Internal Error` code errors should be reported, whereas generally client 400's errors do not need to reported.\n\n## Implementation Considerations\n\nThere are several stand alone processes involved with Dendron. Each one must have an active Sentry client in order for data to be reported.\n\n### Plugin\n\nGetting full reporting coverage in the Plugin is tricky. VS Code extensions run in a Node.JS environment within an Extension Host sandbox. There is no way to intercept all exceptions thrown by plugin code in one callback (see [this issue](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/45264)). Therefore, all extension invocation points must be wrapped in a `try` block with the error reported in the `catch` block. There are many different invocation points in the VSCode API for an extension; all must be wrapped in order to have complete coverage. Currently, Dendron has the following entry points:\n\n- [`activate()`](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/activation-events)\n- [Commands](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/command)\n- Window Events\n    - `window.onDidChangeActiveTextEditor()`\n    - `window.onDidChangeVisibleTextEditors()`\n- Workspace Events\n    - `workspace.onWillSaveTextDocument()`\n    - `workspace.onDidChangeTextDocument()`\n    - `workspace.onDidOpenTextDocument()`\n- File System Watchers\n    - `onDidChange()`\n- Language Features\n    - CodeActionProvider\n    - HoverProvider\n    - CompletionProvider\n    - DefinitionProvider\n    - FoldingRangeProvider\n\nAll callback invocation points in the plugin extension should be wrapped with a `sentryReportingCallback`:\n\n```typescript\n    window.onDidChangeVisibleTextEditors(\n      sentryReportingCallback((editors: TextEditor[]) => {\n        const ctx = \"WindowWatcher:onDidChangeVisibleTextEditors\";\n        ...\n      })\n    );\n```\n\nThere are two kinds of errors being reported in the plugin:\n1. Unhandled Exceptions - any exception thrown in a block wrapped by `sentryReportingCallback`\n1. `Logger.error()` - logging a message at the error level will also upload an event.\n\n### Dendron Engine\n\nThe Dendron express server is configured to forward all errors to a special error handler that will upload error data to Sentry. However, special consideration is required for all `async` handlers. By default, if an asynchronous handler throws an exception resulting in a rejected promise, express will not handle this automatically (see [here](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/error-handling.html)). Therefore, all asynchronous handlers need to be wrapped with an `asyncHandler` that will forward exceptions to the error handler:\n\n```typescript\nrouter.post(\"/render\", asyncHandler(async (req: Request, res: Response) => {\n  const resp = await NoteController.instance().render(\n    req.body as RenderNoteOpts & { ws: string }\n  );\n  ExpressUtils.setResponse(res, resp);\n}));\n```\n\n### CLI\n\nError Reporting has not yet been implemented in the Dendron command line interface. See [[Plugging Existing Gaps|dendron.dev.errors.reporting#plugging-existing-gaps]] below.\n\n## User Privacy\n\nDendron takes user privacy very seriously. Dendron will observe user's telemetry settings - if telemetry is disabled for the client, error data will not be uploaded.\n\nFurthermore, special care must be taken to ensure that error messages do not include any [Personal Identifiable Information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data) or otherwise data that may be sensitive to a user.\n\n## Future Enhancements\n\n### Plugging Existing Gaps\n\nThere are some areas in the code that do not currently upload error reporting. These gaps are intended to be filled with future iterations:\n- Dendron CLI\n- Webviews (TreeView V2, Preview V2, Calendar View, Seed Browser)\n- `logger.error()` occurrences on the Server side.\n\n### Additional Data\n\nThere are also additional data points we can add to improve diagnostics and insights:\n- Add Typescript Source Mapping for better callstack information.\n- Give each thrown `DendronError` a unique ID for deterministic error bucketing and traceability\n- Add Performance Metrics\n\n## Related\n\n[[RFC 19: Error Reporting|dendron.rfc.19-error-reporting]]\n\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/0dHPoULBsEJLRO6iMnMZA.html","relUrl":"notes/0dHPoULBsEJLRO6iMnMZA.html"},{"doc":"Design","title":"Design","hpath":"dendron.dev.design","content":"## Overview\n\nDendron is composed of three main components and a collection of complementing libraries.\n\nBelow is an example of the initialization process\n\n![[dendron://dendron.dendron-site/pkg.dendron-engine.arch#initialization,1:#*]]\n\nDendron has a [[CLI|dendron.topic.cli]] that executes the above workflow as well, except replace `plugin` with `cli`.

Not all views can be re-implemented for dendron\n- normal file system permissions could be used to limit visibility to certain sub-hierarchies\n- various sub-parts of the hierarchy can be brought into the same workspace via symlinks\n- Is compliant with enterprise setting, many companies just wouldn't adopt dot-based hierarcies for their knowledge-base (it's \"too weird\", \"unproven\" etc.)\n\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/da241d31-8a05-429c-a041-02ac6170bf20.html","relUrl":"notes/da241d31-8a05-429c-a041-02ac6170bf20.html"},{"doc":"Summary","title":"Summary","hpath":"dendron.dev.design.engine","content":"These documents are a high level overview of the code inside Dendron. They are written in a type script like pseudo code. The code blocks are broken down into the following structure:\n\n```\n# {Function}  --> what is happening\n## Summary    --> high level function call of what is happening\n## Flows      --> pseudo code describing high level functions\n\n### {Flow Entry}\n\n- loc: ... --> where code is located. {package}/{basename}\n- desc: ... --> description \n```\n\n## Pseudo Code\n\nThe code description is typescript-ish. The goal isn't to write valid typescript but be a **summarized** version of the code. The syntax is evolving but here is a loosely documented starting point:\n\n- @: equivalent of `this.`\n- $: referencing a global variable\n- `...`: code that is omitted because it would clutter the summary\n- `=:` magic equality, \n\nThe places where you see this convention being broken (eg. actual valid typescript) are areas where the author got lazy and just copied code into the summary. Try to not do this because that defeats the point of a _summarized_ view. That being said, Dendron is all about being pragmatic and taking an iterative approach to things. \n\n# Initializing the Engine\n\n## Summary\n\n- engine.query\n  - store.query\n    - FileParser.parse\n      ```ts\n      allFiles {\n        getFileMeta\n        toNode\n      }\n      ```\n    -

This is because lerna symlinks mono-repo dependencies together and a `yarn add` would override that. Instead, use the following command:\n\n```\nlerna add {package-to-install} --scope @dendronhq/{package-to-install-into}\n```\n\nBecause this is typescript, don't forget to also install the `@types` package if it exists\n\n```bash\nlerna add @types/{package-to-install} --scope @dendronhq/{package-to-install-into}\n```\n\n- NOTE: watch out that you are installing dependencies in the right package. Missing dependencies will appear to work in development if that dependency is present in any of the other packages. The reason things work is because of the way the nodejs module resolution works and that we're in a monorepo. Dependencies are installed at the root of the monorepo and will be found there when the package doesn't have them. When we publish them as npm packages, these dependencies will show up as missing in their respective packages if its not included in the dependencies\n\n### Add a new node package\n\n- initialize repo\n\n```bash\ncd {workspace_dir}\ncp -R /path/to/dendron-yeoman/node-ts packages/{new-package}\n```\n\n- update `package.json`\n\n  - change project name\n\n- publish the repo (needs to be done initially before running lerna publish)\n\n```\nnpm publish --access public\n```\n\n### Using eslint\n\nAll packages in the repo use a standard base configuration found at [.eslintrc.js](.eslintrc.js). If you're using the VS Code and would like to see eslint violations on it, install the [eslint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint).\n\n### Using a local npm registry\n\n- pre-req:\n  - install verdaccio\n\n```sh\nsource bootstrap/scripts/helpers.sh\nsetRegLocal\nverdaccio\n```\n\n### Adding a new husky hook\n\nThe following is an example of adding a hook that checks whether any imports have the form `\"../(common-frontend|...)\"` and fail to push if so\n\n```diff\n+++ b/hooks/pre-push.js\n@@ -2,6 +2,7 @@ const {checkToken} = require(\"./common\");\n const {exec} = require(\"./exec\");\n\n function main() {\n   // Where we would push if we ran `git push`\n   let upstream;\n   try {\n@@ -9,15 +10,18 @@ function main() {\n   } catch {\n     // Fallback to first origin if none are set\n     upstream = `${exec(\"git remote\").stdout.trim().split(\"\\n\")[0]}/master`;\n   }\n   // The files that would get pushed\n   const filesToPush = exec(`git diff --name-only ${upstream}`).stdout.split('\\n');\n\n   return checkToken({\n     filesToCheck: filesToPush,\n     forbiddenTokens: {\n       \".only\": { rgx: /(describe|it|test)\\.only/, fileRgx: /\\.spec\\.ts$/ },\n       \"debugger;\": { rgx: /(^|\\s)debugger;/, fileRgx: /\\.ts$/ },\n+      \"rel import of monorepo pkg\": { rgx: /(\\.\\.\\/(common-frontend|common-all|common-server|engine-server|dendron-cli|pods-core|api-server|common-test-utils|engine-test-utils|dendron-next-server))/, fileRgx: /\\.ts[x]?$/ },\n     }\n   });\n }\n```\n\n## Config\n\n### Update JSON Config with comments\nDendron works with JSON with comments when working the a vscode workspace file, snippets file or the keybindings file. When making a change here, take care to both read and write to the file while preserving comments. \n\nYou'll want to make sure to use the following functions to read, assign and write json with comments\n\n```ts\nasync function readJSONWithComments(fpath: string)\nfunction assignJSONWithComment(jsonObj: any, dataToAdd: any) {\nfunction writeJSONWithComments(fpath: string, data: any)\n```\n\n### Add a new site config option\n\nThe following is an example of controlling formatting options to the DendronSiteConfig. You can see the [issue](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/278) for more details.\n\nDendron currently will auto-format notes during `Rename` and `Refactor` operations when links inside a note need to be replaced.\n\nThe formatting options are defined [here](https://dendron.so/notes/849ee8ee-05a5-47bf-b44d-d7c257117bc4.html#renaming-a-note).\n\nThese are [rough notes](https://dendron.so/notes/849ee8ee-05a5-47bf-b44d-d7c257117bc4.html#flow) of how formatting gets called during rename\n\nTo make this customizable, the following changes need to be made:\n\n- [ ] update the [DendronConfig type definition](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/common-all/src/types/typesv2.ts)\n- [ ] update [config defaults](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/engine-server/src/config.ts#L42:L42)\n- [ ] pass in formatting options from the [plugin](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/plugin-core/src/commands/RenameNoteV2a.ts#L137:L137)\n- [ ] accept formatting args in the [server](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/api-server/src/routes/note.ts#L38:L38)\n- [ ] accept formatting args in the [engine](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/engine-server/src/enginev2.ts#L249:L249)\n- [ ] accept it when [replacing links](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/engine-server/src/markdown/utilsv5.ts)\n- [ ] accept it in [remark pipeline](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/engine-server/src/markdown/remark/utils.ts)\n\nWhen all this is done, we can add tests that the formatting behavior works\n\n- [ ] [engine tests](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/blob/master/packages/engine-test-utils/src/__tests__/engine-server/enginev2.spec.ts)\n\nThe above changes are for `Rename`. `Refactor` calls rename in a loop so changing rename should update refactor as well.\n\n### Adding a general configuration\n\nSee [[Adding new configuration|pkg.dendron-plugin.dev#adding-new-configuration]]\n\n\n## Plugin\n-

What used to be called `DendronWorkspace` is now a `DendronExtension`. The `DendronExtension` can contain a workspace, which can either be a `code` workspace or a `native` workspace. \n\nThe new startup process is described [[here|pkg.dendron-plugin.arch.startup#summary]]\n\n### Changes\n- `DendronWorkspace` renamed to `DendronExtension`\n- `getWS` renamed to `getExtension`\n- introduce `getDWorkspace` which returns `DWorkspaceV2`\n    - `DWorkspaceV2` has a subset of properties from `DendronWorkspace` that (in future releases) can be accessed independently from vscode itself\n- removed\n    - `DendronWorkspace.instance` (use `getExtension`)\n    - `DendronWorkspace.wsRoot` (use `getDWorkspace().wsRoot`)\n    - `DendronWorkspace.vaults` (use `getDWorkspace().vaults`)\n    - `DendronWorkspace.config` (use `getDWorkspace().config`)\n    - `DendronWorkspace.extensionAssetsDir` (use `getDWorkspace().assetUri`)\n\n### Usage\n- any property that used to be accessed using `DendronWorkspace.instance` or `getWS` is now either a property of `getExtension` or `getDWorkspace`\n\n### Related\n- Work item: [[Tasks|scratch.2021.09.04.161012.workspace-refactoring-for-standalone-vaults#tasks]]\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/H7CgvT7YUYAiV7mEmGnky.html","relUrl":"notes/H7CgvT7YUYAiV7mEmGnky.html"},{"doc":"Build","title":"Build","hpath":"dendron.dev.build","content":"\n\n## Cook\n\n### Building from clean repo\n\nSometimes you'll need to rebuild the workspace from scratch.

Note that features with 🚧 are still under active development and might not be fully implemented.\n\n### Markdown\n\nDendron supports markdown, a popular markup syntax that is like HTML but 1000x simpler. If you are new to markdown, you can read about the syntax [here](https://docs.gitbook.com/editing-content/markdown).\n\n### Frontmatter\n\nFrontmatter is a convenient way of adding extra information to your documents like a shorthand title or longer description (think any extra information you can use to describe a note). This type of information is generally called metadata and the structure used is called [YAML](https://yaml.org/). You can add it to the front of your markdown file and it won't show up in the preview. It was first introduced by [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/). \n\nYou can read more about the frontmatter used in Dendron [[here|dendron.topic.frontmatter]]\n\n### Workspace\n\n![[dendron.ref.workspace#summary,1]]\n\n### Vaults\n\n![[dendron.topic.vaults#summary,1:#*]]\n\n### Hierarchies\n\n![[dendron.topic.hierarchies#Summary,1:#concepts]]\n\nYou can read more about hierarchies [[here|dendron.topic.hierarchies]]\n\n### Domain\n\nA domain is the root of a hierarchy. In the example below, `project1` would be the domain.\n\n```\n.\n├── project1.md\n├── project1.designs.md\n├── project1.designs.promotion.md\n├── project1.paperwork.md\n├── project1.paperwork.legal.md\n├── project1.tasks.md\n├── project1.tasks.task1.md\n└── project1.tasks.task2.md\n```\n\n### Schema\n\nAs you end up creating more notes, it can be hard to keep track of it all. This is why Dendron has **schemas** to help you manage your notes. Think of schemas as an **optional type system** for your information. They describe the hierarchy of your notes and are themselves, represented as a hierarchy. \n\nYou can create a schema by adding a YAML file with the following naming scheme `{name}.schema.yml` to your workspace. \n\nBelow is an example of a three-level hierarchy describing cli commands. You don't need to concern yourself with the details of the schema syntax just yet, just know that this schema will match the following [glob patterns](https://facelessuser.github.io/wcmatch/glob/): `cli.*`, `cli.*.cmd`, `cli.*.cmd.*`, `cli.*.env`\n\n```yml\n- id: cli\n  desc: command line interface reference\n  parent: root\n  namespace: true\n  children:\n    - cmd\n    - env\n- id: env\n  desc: variables relevant for command\n- id: cmd\n  desc: subcommands \n  namespace: true\n```\n\n### Stubs\n\nStubs are notes that don't exist but that you might want to create. They will show up as suggestions in lookup results.\nThere are two reasons why these suggested notes might show up: \n\n- they are the uncreated parent of a note deeper in the hierarchy (eg. `foo.bar` might be a stub for `foo.bar.foobar`)\n- they are possible notes according to the schema\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/schema-plus.jpg)\n\n> The `+` sign next to the suggestion indicates that the note is a stub and does not exist \n\n### Pods\n\n[[Pods|dendron.topic.pod]] are the mechanisms Dendron uses to import and export notes. Dendron has a different pod depending on where you are getting and publishing your data to. \n\n### Command Palette\n\nThe command palette is native to `vscode`. You can use it to run dendron commands, which will all be prefixed with `Dendron:`. You can use the following shortcut to open the command palette.\n\n- <img src=\"https://www.kernel.org/theme/images/logos/favicon.png\" width=16 height=16/> <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-linux.pdf\">Linux</a> `Ctrl+Shift+P`\n- <img src=\"https://developer.apple.com/favicon.ico\" width=16 height=16/> <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-macos.pdf\">macOS</a> `Cmd+Shift+P`\n- <img src=\"https://www.microsoft.com/favicon.ico\" width=16 height=16/> <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-windows.pdf\">Windows</a> `Ctrl+Shift+P`\n\n### Lookup Bar\n\nThe lookup bar is how you interact with notes inside of Dendron. Use it to create, find, and delete notes. You can type `> Dendron: Lookup` in the `Command Palette` or use the `Ctrl+L` shortcut. \n\n- <img src=\"https://www.kernel.org/theme/images/logos/favicon.png\" width=16 height=16/> <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-linux.pdf\">Linux</a> `Ctrl+L`\n- <img src=\"https://developer.apple.com/favicon.ico\" width=16 height=16/> <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-macos.pdf\">macOS</a> `Cmd+L`\n- <img src=\"https://www.microsoft.com/favicon.ico\" width=16 height=16/> <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-windows.pdf\">Windows</a> `Ctrl+L`\n\n![](assets/2020-07-07-20-14-57.png)\n\n\n## Misc\n\n### Glob Pattern\n\nGlob patterns are a way of pattern matching characters. You can test and see more example of glob patterns [here](https://facelessuser.github.io/wcmatch/glob/).\n\n### Kebab Case\n\nKebab case is when you replace spaces with dashes and upper case with lower case.\n\n- Example\n    - `Hello World` -> `hello-world`\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/c6fd6bc4-7f75-4cbb-8f34-f7b99bfe2d50.html","relUrl":"notes/c6fd6bc4-7f75-4cbb-8f34-f7b99bfe2d50.html"},{"doc":"Community","title":"Community","hpath":"dendron.community","content":"\nDendron wouldn't be what it is today without our wonderful set of members and supporters.\n\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/6f4cd441-f883-4e75-871b-b7f93895c91b.html","relUrl":"notes/6f4cd441-f883-4e75-871b-b7f93895c91b.html"},{"doc":"Showcase","title":"Showcase","hpath":"dendron.community.showcase","content":"Below are examples of published Dendron vaults\n\n## Official\n\n### Dendron homepage\n\n- homepage: <https://dendron.so>\n  ![](/assets/images/2020-09-13-09-05-45.png)\n\n### Open PKM Catalogue\n\n- homepage: <https://pkm.dendron.so>\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/showcase.pkm.jpg)\n\n### Open AWS Catalogue\n\n- homepage: <https://aws.dendron.so>\n\n![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/images/showcase.aws.jpg)\n\n## Members\n\n### Kevin's page\n\n- homepage: <https://kevinslin.com/>\n- discord: `@kevins8#0590`\n  ![](/assets/images/2020-09-13-08-45-00.png)\n\n### Luke's second brain\n\n- homepage: <https://luke.carrier.im/>\n- discord: `@lukecarrier#2081`\n\n![](/assets/images/2020-09-27-20-50-54.png)\n\n### Ian's digital garden\n\n- homepage: <https://garden.ianjones.us/>\n- discord: `@ianjones#3696`\n\n![](/assets/images/2020-12-06-09-43-31.png)\n\n### Kevin's digital garden (another one)\n\n- homepage: garden.kevincunningham.co.uk\n- discord: `@dolearning (Kevin)#3551`\n\n![ScreenShot of @dolearning digital garden](https://res.cloudinary.com/kc-cloud/image/upload/v1607614868/digital_garden_screenshot_j9wrcz.png)\n\n\n### Cameron's digital garden\n\n- homepage: <https://notes.serendipidata.com/>\n- discord: `@cameron#9185`\n\n![](https://p-qkfgo2.t2.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/WnuBJ0L1/8befb6dd-740d-4088-bbeb-b5c21954e308.jpg?v=4e54f3d2ffbbe051c195eab04c72971f)\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/3a82c5ff-7945-46ae-8bf9-3b2275fc6642.html","relUrl":"notes/3a82c5ff-7945-46ae-8bf9-3b2275fc6642.html"},{"doc":"Roles","title":"Roles","hpath":"dendron.community.roles","content":"\n## Summary\nDendron has special roles for members of its community.\n\nIf you'd like to credit someone for work, you can simply ask the contribution bot ([contribution-key](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key)): `@all-contributors please add @<username> for <contributions>.` ^NE2TMz6wxONj\n\nCommon keys are:\n- bug\n- doc\n\nYou can either use the bot in the relevant Github issue OR in the [gratitude issue](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/714).\n\nYou can see the list of contributors [here](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron#contributors-).\n\n## Roles\n\n### Dendrologist\n\n**Dendrologist** are active members of the Dendron community.

And in this talk, I will be showcasing my personal journey through personal knowledge management, and how dendron has helped me set everything up.\n\nUnknown Speaker  0:43  \nAlthough I have been taking notes, all my life, the concept of PKM has been something very new to me. And I've been spending a lot of time to pass a good chunk of this year, absorbing a lot of information about PKM. And this is my current state at how I'm implementing things. So I'm definitely not like an expert in this. But I hope this talk can give other people who are just starting out a sense of self efficacy towards building their own personal management, personal knowledge management system.\n\nUnknown Speaker  1:38  \nSo\n\nUnknown Speaker  1:42  \nlet's see.\n\nUnknown Speaker  1:48  \nLet's start with how I found dendron. I found dendron. Out of out of random chance, to be honest, I thought I would, it would be a great good idea to learn how to roll out my own static website. So it was a good excuse to learn things like react, Gatsby, stuff like that. And at the end, I did I did kind of revive my personal website that I've been neglecting for almost 10 years. During the process, I learned about MDX. And I was intrigued by how people were just using markdown to manage their content for for publishing. And this got me kind of exciting because this meant I can I can start writing just simply writing notes, and then can become like blog posts or anything really that kind of that I can publish on my website.\n\nUnknown Speaker  3:07  \nAnd then I cut that idea. Then like all personal kind of portfolio websites go, I had to write an about page for me. And I'm not really I really struggle with introducing myself to other people who I am. So I was really struggling How do I how do I write this and like a concise, like, like a cool way. And I found out about the now page and it's basically just the page where you list things that are going on in your life right now. And and I have an app and I have a link. I can link in later but someone started it and has like, has like a compilation of everyone's now page that they submitted. And let me do while while checking out other people's now page. And that's when I discovered the concept of digital gardens. And then a lot of searching later, I found a lot of tools and then yeah, that's how I got to got to dendron I started using it. I actually felt like it was a project that I want to contribute for the first time in life. And I and I did. And it felt great. And I kind of never looked back. I think that was like seven or eight months ago. Yeah. So that was How I found dendron. That's when I started actually\n\nUnknown Speaker  5:06  \nmy digital garden.\n\nUnknown Speaker  5:15  \nLet's, let's go over how my personal garden is set up. So I can't actually see what I'm sharing right now. But it should be sharing just my VS code window. Is that correct? Yes, that's correct. So this is two thirds of my actual screen. So about half, the size of half of this fiasco is Windows on my left. So it's always, mostly all like, all my windows are arranged like this. And my, my VS code is on the second two thirds of my screen, so that my first column is here, which is actually, I'm not showing it but it's in the center of my screen. I'm looking at the first column, and it's in the, in the middle. And here, right now I have I have another note open here. But usually I just put a note graph and a preview. And sometimes I have a terminal here, so that when I want to use it, I can just switch tabs and use the terminal. On the bottom, I have another another editor group, to say, I think that's called other group. I have that set up for any notes that I want to reference. But I don't actually write here, if I want to write, I bring it here. And whenever I'm taking notes, I'm, I'm writing here, and then referencing wherever it is, whatever is here. That's my layout.\n\nUnknown Speaker  7:14  \nAnd,\n\nUnknown Speaker  7:17  \nlet's see.\n\nUnknown Speaker  7:22  \nSo on my on my main column, where I actually write, I have usually I have a daily journal that is pinned. And I also have another note called buffer. This is a type of special note that I'm kind of experimenting using. Personally, this is not part of dendron right now. It is a single notes that that process, I never, I never deleted or move it to other places, it's just there. And I use it kind of like how you would use a scratch note and dendron it's sort of a similar analogy, except that you would create a lot of scratch notes for for other needs. But for buffering notes, I just have it there pinned. And whenever I think I'm done writing, I just flush it out to an appropriate place. So for instance, if I were to be writing things about are, are human anatomy, stuff like that, I would have that. And I would just copy paste it to a place that I think is suitable. I do this because sometimes even just creating a scratch note is kind of like an overhead. So I just want to start like, late. If I have an idea that I want to copy, or copy paste or type right away, he wants to know to be there already. And I don't want to think about the possible kind of like, like, like title of the notes, or where I want to link the note so I Don't Forget it, forget it, it's there, stuff like that. So I would write here and then find a place that would be suitable. Like something like this and then just go there. And buffer note is still there. I just it's just flushed and ready for for for next use. And I I'm experimenting how well this works and the stuff that might be useful to facilitate this kind of pattern. So that maybe I can do a feature request or implement myself\n\nUnknown Speaker  10:07  \na mic question. First, I love the boyfriend note. And I definitely I can totally see this as something that can be part of tension just because it's an even easier way to just jot down your thoughts. Do you ever have like multiple thoughts like built up like right now like you were able to put down some notes and move them right away? But do you ever just let it build up? And what is your process of triage thing that note once you have maybe like a day's worth of notes, or a week's worth of notes, but maybe you never let it get to that point, I'm just curious about the process right now.\n\nUnknown Speaker  10:49  \nUsually, so this is the part where buffer node kind of loses its its meaning because something like that, if I have a lot of notes to during the day, I that, that the purposes buffer buffer notes can be completely replaced by daily journals right now. So I'll just open a random daily journal, something that's more than that. So I was going to go over the general way of how I take notes on another section, but I'll just go over it right now I have, I usually almost just start with a timestamp. So here would be like, I have a snippet that just paste the time and the date. And then I would have I would have a note that's related to the thought or if I don't, I would just start my notes. And then maybe this goes to blah, blah, blah. And then I create the note, then it goes on. So almost everything I take notes here would end up becoming a node within my serve barium. So I keep it here. I don't think I ever went back and triage that because something like most of the notes that I take here are meta stuff about the the pages I want to to develop. So whatever things that need to be moved. I, I will write it here. But I would also move into the irrelevant notes. And I think a buffer is another higher abstraction over the daily journal because it's, it's it's like something that i i think it's just doesn't fit anywhere. Not in my daily journal, not in my any pre existing journals, I just need a place to to write it. I can flush it to other notes or just deleted it's just but I have I at least I have it that I don't have to think about where do I put it? That's, that's where I started using buffer notes. And yeah, does that answer your question? Yeah,\n\nUnknown Speaker  13:39  \nthat makes sense that Do you still, I guess, do you use my friend? Oh, it's like in conjunction with daily journals? Or have you switched mostly to just use buffers in the placement of that?\n\nUnknown Speaker  13:50  \nNo, I still, I still use both. Sometimes I write stuff in the buffering node, and then I just paste it with a timestamp into my daily. Because sometimes the Delta denotes that I have before. It's kind of like a clutter. And I just want to clean space that that I want to work on this particular idea. I say idea, but I just really, it's just simple stuff in my life right now.\n\nUnknown Speaker  14:23  \nThat's where all the best ideas come from. And one more question for note and let you continue the presentation. Can you go more in detail with the illustration that you have especially like the little numbers in the bottom? Right.\n\nUnknown Speaker  14:37  \nThis is a quick scan of my, my my physical journal that I that I keep. It looks like this. I don't know if it's Yeah. So that is for tomorrow, July 31. So I always Write this before the day actually happens. But I was going to talk about how I separate my concerns with other other tools like pen and paper, then German, and whatnot. So this will be part of the talk in a later section.\n\nUnknown Speaker  15:25  \nCool. Sounds good. Don't let me hold you up.\n\nUnknown Speaker  15:29  \nOkay, so, so buffer notes, basically deferring my decision of the location of the note to a future time so that I can capture the immediacy of my thoughts. And then I we already sorry about this, to assume you is kind of struggling. My tabs? So yeah. Yeah, I guess I already did kind of go over what I was going to talk about for daily journals here, because mine notes are very sparse like this. Because sometimes I just don't work on the daily, I just work on the actual notes. Yeah, this is, that's where I, I thought about buffering notes, by the way. So quickly reiterating timestamp, then whatever idea I have, I just write it down without thinking about the structure of how I want to organize this. I like to write now naturally, just just sequentially until I can sense kind of intuitively sense a structure in it. And before that, I don't really want I don't like, like, like applying a structure in it. So one, this is kind of off topic, but but the firt, like, trying to organize my knowledge. All I did was create notes. And this was when I first started using dendron. So I was, really this is, this is a silly thing to do. But I would make a bunch of notes, they're all empty. But I would just dump all the dump out what I'm interested in, and I tried to make a rigid structure out of all the things I all the things I know and am interested about. And after like a month, I would have like 200 nodes started with zero. And they're all empty, I do nothing with it, I just keep on making new notes. And then I realize this is not how you do it. I have to start with a seed and an idea that I can take actions so that whatever that goes into my note or whatever note I create, actually means something to me. So if you I hope this show shows. So this is the current state of my node. And there's not a lot because currently, I have like 130 nodes. And I think I deleted more than like, like 60% of my notes because it because they were all empty, and I didn't have a purpose and actually structuring it that way. I think that's a good thing. And this is I think, is a perfect segue to my\n\nUnknown Speaker  19:15  \nnext\n\nUnknown Speaker  19:17  \nthing I want to talk about.\n\nUnknown Speaker  19:21  \nWhich is\n\nUnknown Speaker  19:25  \nno, I wanted to talk about something else for us. So let's do that. First one. See, bye for now. Yeah. So dendron and, like, I mean, Sarah barium that I did I did I use dendrite to build is the source of truth from my notes. But it's not the only tool I use. I do this because I want to separate the Separate what kind of notes I put in sir barium or, or my other tools. For example, most of the notes about the daily minutia they, I don't think it has value to go into serve barium. It's either I do it, and I acknowledge it, that I did it or I didn't do it that day. I just move on, there's no like, I, of course, there's, there's people who track what they do, and use that data to extract insights and do other stuff. But that's, I don't do that. yet. I think, like I don't think I have, I don't think I have an urge to do that. yet. So I don't do that. And mostly these kind of little things that I that I, I mean, like, this is this is the the, this is an example this is a, I just use, this is a pocket sized notebook, again, about the size, a passport, it's actually called a passport notes. And if it's in my pocket, and there's no excuse for me to not have it all the time, even when I probably don't need to, to, to. to have it on me, for example, like going for a run. I do this because these are the things that I want to have access all the time immediately without even like clicking on an app, selecting a node and and trying to figure out what I want to what I want to look at, I just have a spread for every day was the same format that has a task and things I need to take care of. And then set time blocked out. So that I have an idea of how much free time I have today. And it constantly reminds me that I don't really have that much time today. And I have to like I don't I don't have time to slack off. So immediacy is the key for me here. And I tried a lot of ways of doing like to do notes using apps, using other other programs software. But it always the blocker always for me was that I need Internet access, or some kind of thinking. And if I didn't have my phone with, with my with me, I just can't do it. But a simple pen and paper solution was the way I make immediate tasks. And now like, if I don't have this before the day ends, for for, for then for the next day. The next day is kind of a kind of kind of chaos, because I really don't I rely on this so much that I don't know what to do that day.\n\nUnknown Speaker  23:41  \nAnyway, so a question. So do you make this calendar or this crap every day? Like, do you have one? Or do you use like a template that you use every day?\n\nUnknown Speaker  23:58  \nI draw this and write this every day. I this is another tangent that I won't actually go into but I used to my handwriting used to be like, really like something that you would the thing you would get came out on a printer. So I was really I'm really Oh, I think I'm still am but I'm really OCD and some at some point in my life. I thought writing perfect, like pixel perfect. words would help me like learn better. But that's not the case. And I don't I'm not going to go into this more. But yeah, I like I like writing with my hand and it makes me slow down and think about stuff that I want to write down. And without these kind of notes. I just can't function as a normal human being so slowing down Down, to write this down, at the end of the day to shut shut down and have kind of like a daily daily closure, so to speak. It's it's meditative. And I just I just like, I've, it's very pleasing to Me to look at this. So I think that it's emotionally a good thing for me. And it also it serves a purpose for me. So I kind of, I kind of do it as kind of a meditation, stuff like that manually every day,\n\nUnknown Speaker  25:35  \nhow to edit, it looks really, it looks like a really nice routine. So curious. And your writing is amazing. Mine is not.\n\nUnknown Speaker  25:50  \nYeah, so. So with this kind of pocket notebook, like you, like this is a very, like, I've, like I've been doing this for at least like three years on on the same type of notes for about three years. And when I first started, I was even more imperative. What I tell myself to do for, for example, my to do app would be like, wake up, take your, take your trash bag, and pile up all at your door, do the dishes, and then take it out stuff like that, like a very, very, like imperative kind of style of, of scheduling your day. But yeah, my point is that it tends to be in on like, a very imperative, like you have like, procedures of what you need to do that day, on this note. And for all the notes that I take in, sir barium using dendron. It's more declarative, I have more abstract ideas about what I want to do. And then the notes I take usually aren't tasks. It's ideas, and then whatever comes out of that could be tax tasks. But I usually try to write notes in dendron. In a way that you're having a conversation, almost like I'm, like, externalizing, my, my, my, my thinking, to like, like another person almost. And I'm talking to dungeon, as if I'm talking to a friend about a topic. And I think that helps me think about the ideas that I always had, but couldn't organize in my head, it's, I think it's a good way to pull it out. Okay, so that is, I think, pretty much it about separation of concerns that I want to talk about. So the next section is, what kind of content that comes in to my notes, what stays and what I what I expect to make out of that. So all external information that I get from books, articles, General videos, or just just word of mouth, they all go in to a hierarchy called e x t. And I have some rules here about how I want to organize this. This is all public, by the way, if you go to serve breatharian dot garden is all published. So I'm not going to go into the the rules that I put for myself, but I have all for example. I've read this book called Deep work. I have my reading notes here. I have another book that I'm reading right now, but I don't have notes here. There's probably something about lowering your blood pressure. Any information that I don't put input myself, it comes to this hierarchy. So that whenever I want to reference it in other places,\n\nUnknown Speaker  30:22  \nI have a place that I know where it is. And I've seen people just have a big hierarchy that has all their notes, their reading notes, they're what they call fleeting notes into zettelkasten. They're permanent notes that have their own ideas all mixed up. But I thought it would be nice to have some kind of separation, I haven't really seen a very compelling reason that you should do it like this. But this is something I'm experimenting right now. That having one hierarchy and, and a pretty flat one that just goes right into the source, and then my notes. And then these are used to write my journals. If I if I go to backlinks, yeah, there are some things that I link here. I did some research about dash with, which is how you should eat, if you have hypertension, stuff like that. So usually I I have a, taken some information, lets it, process it in my own ways, and then make notes. And then I take that and put my own thoughts, probably first and my daily journal. And then if I think it's worth putting it into my other permanent notes, I move it there. And then, like I mentioned before, I would sometimes have notes that are empty, it's because I thought I would be working on those notes. But I didn't. And I forgot about it.\n\nUnknown Speaker  32:41  \nIt's not much overhead to have it there all the time. Keeping it empty, but I always make it a case to go and delete it. And what I what I normally do is I use dendron. And in my notes, and I just keep on going this doing this until I find an empty note. But this note is not actually empty because it has other children. So go on, keep doing that until I find a random note that's empty. And then I decide do I want to work on it today? If not, I'm going to delete it. So that's how I tend to kind of prove my, my my digital garden. Hey, Mark, and\n\nUnknown Speaker  33:41  \njust a question on my site. This is great. I'm just curious, I noticed that. So right now, I guess for people who aren't using dungeon dungeon has an option to automatically take your frontmatter and put it as the h1 title and the preview. And so I've noticed this, you've been going through some of your notes, some of your notes, you've been relying on the frontmatter tighter title, but some of them you've been putting an h1 title, like the current one. So like you see our chart twice. Is there do you have like a preference or like a way that you like, decide to put an h1 title in a note versus just using the title field? Or just you know, what is your favorite layout for that?\n\nUnknown Speaker  34:31  \nI started out just using h1 titles. That's why some of the notes I have do have h1 titles, some don't. It's just that I had it like that. But at some point, I got into a habit of just using the the front metal type matter title. So I guess I don't really have preference but right now I'm just any new node that I have. May I use the frontmatter? title? So this is a pretty old note. You can see it's made last year and never touched again after February.\n\nUnknown Speaker  35:14  \nGot it. And I guess this is just like as a plug for people that are not aware, because it's really hard to discover. We have a doctor command if you're in this situation to change our h1 title. So if all notes to the frontmatter title instead.\n\nUnknown Speaker  35:30  \nYes, that is true. And I need to do that. I guess I'm still undecided. That's why I'm not I'm running. I'm not running that command. So yeah, we'll see. We'll see.\n\nUnknown Speaker  35:50  \nI don't mean to date into that. But please continue.\n\nUnknown Speaker  35:54  \nSorry, I haven't been looking at the the chat at all. Sorry about that.\n\nUnknown Speaker  36:01  \nUm, yeah, there hasn't been. It's been a side conversation. So we're okay. I'll let you know if there's any questions. Yeah,\n\nUnknown Speaker  36:09  \nthat'd be great. So let's say, yeah. So that's how I prune my notes. What was I going to talk about again, so what's my end game with these. So I had a really, I have, I still have a really bad problem of having very big, big ideas, and never executing. I have a lot of hobbies, a lot, a lot of interest. And I looked into a lot of information, I never make use of that information. And I never do anything about it. So that was the thing I wanted to fix this year. And with perfect timing, I found out about digital guarding it was something that could help me do that. So I made it a point that all the notes at the end makes me do something. And then when you when I do that, I have a place to record what I did. And it's kind of like the positive feedback loop of keep on doing stuff. As I see my digital garden grow as my knowledge base grow, and just pushed me to not being lazy. Just keep on doing finding things that you thought about, but never did. So my point here is that all notes I want at the end, if it's not something that I want to reference later, kind of like this cheat sheet. It's just something that can output an actionable next step. That is what I aim to make my notes do for me. Does that mean that that was a lot of words? But yeah.\n\nUnknown Speaker  38:24  \nYeah, you want to make sure that the notes that you have to know Yeah, sitting down that they're actionable?\n\nUnknown Speaker  38:28  \nYeah. Yeah. So I don't I that's why I kind of didn't want to just make a to do kind of a to do list and just have inboxes. I do have an inbox but like, just inboxes. And then files that I want it that I just just file in random information that I found that never looked into. So that's kind of like my explicit goal. Explicit kind of goal I set for myself for using dunja and building up my digital garden. Yeah. That's what goes in what stays what comes out of cerebral area. And another thing I wanted to talk about this, there are a lot of popular PKM methods out there. And all of them are great. The people who started that idea, they're all like, like, it's brilliant. All of them are brilliant. That's why a lot of people use it. And I've that's why I've been drawn into everything, like each and every method that I tried, but they all kind of failed. Like, well, I guess I failed on I failed to embrace Every one of them. And I thought about this a lot. And it was just that, like, nobody thinks the same. These are messages that are made a tailored for whoever created that. And there might be people that think similar to them and close to them. But at the end of the day, everyone thinks differently, and all the pipelines are different for people. So what I started doing is a look at all the failed attempts of employing these methods and just taking out the good stuff. For example, para, I thought it would work really well, because it was something simple. But I didn't want to organize every aspect of my life. And in my note in dendron, at least, and the separation of projects, areas, wasn't resources. And then archives areas part kind of felt a bit forced to me it was it just kind of look very tightly coupled with projects and resources. So I didn't really want to follow that to the tee. But I decided that the spirit of para, of having these kind of different level of abstractions of different areas of your real life was meaningful. So I took that, and I hope that it shows in, in my digital garden, when you take time and take a look into it. Settle caston if I were a researcher or was still in academia, I think I would have gone full setup, Gaston because I think it's a really good way to organize information that you absorb, and then output something of your own writing. Really great. And you can see in my x t hierarchy, that I pretty much follow what the central casting method suggests us to do with all all your reading notes. I don't really take fleeting notes separately, I just I just punch it all up into reading notes. And then an important thing that I have to mention is that writing is not my end goal. Right? Writing is just a side effect of what I really want to do, which is push my actions out of out of my head. And actually make me do that and then record that along the way. So writing is a side effect of all that. So follow settle cast and what it suggests to a tee because then I would be focusing on something that I'm not\n\nUnknown Speaker  43:36  \naiming to focus. So so I just adopt parts of what it suggests, like like reading notes, taking notes, processing the information in your own head and writing with your own words, stuff like that. Yeah. Bullet general light light guy introduced with my pen and paper stuff for my dailies. It's good for immediate stuff that are very procedural imperative, but I couldn't just like the, the there is a physical kind of like wall you hit. If you try to organize your knowledge in an analog analog method, LDS is what I'm what I'm feeling. It just gets too unwieldy because, like, you know, like, at least you need some not not a tiny notebook like this. You at least like need need, like a letter size notebook or something like that. And then you need multiple of them. And, you know, yeah, the physical limitation wasn't something that I want wanted to Take, go through. Yeah. So, but writing with my hand was something that I really liked. And then it was immediate, I didn't need my phone or my computer. So what I did is I made my a, I gave myself a place that I can write down things that I care about tomorrow, and not be too precious about. So that's, that's a, that's the way I, I adopted bullet journals. What's another one? There's a lot of things that I read, and then kind of just, like, took the spirit of it and then tried to come up with my own kind of pipeline and into, into what would make sense to me, essentially. But like I said earlier, most of the time, I don't try to make structure before I can see a pattern intuitively. So it's an ongoing process of checking out new stuff. trying it out failing, and then just taking the spirit and trying to make it come naturally to me. Okay, I think that's pretty much all all methods that I can think about that I kind of took parts to, to come to this point right now.\n\nUnknown Speaker  46:49  \nYeah, and I think for people who might not be as familiar with different notetaking techniques, we'll be sure to also all the terms that Mark mentioned, like para and central casting and seeding notes. And we'll have a glass screen that comes out, can we also publish your talk?\n\nUnknown Speaker  47:10  \nAs there would be PK involved, that goes into the details of how and what they suggest you do with your knowledge?\n\nUnknown Speaker  47:21  \nYeah, thanks for the reminder. So yeah, dungeon has, we have published a reference guide for what all the different PKM techniques do and some ways of implementing them? So I guess one more thing to add. I know we talked about it, but I don't think we're the listener. So the people tuning in might know is for your digital garden. Why did you decide to name it Sarah premium and the story behind me.\n\nUnknown Speaker  47:59  \nIt's I, I have, I have a tendency to name things. And it's, it's part of my grandiose, kind of, like, like, like staying inside my head, like brewing of big ideas. So I started using it. And then this is the like, it's very funny, because at the time, I started getting into, like, learning about digital gardens, I was actually getting into gardening. I mean, like, like, like growing plants. So I wanted something with a planned theme. Because, you know, like, I want to buy a domain, dot domain, Garden, dot, dot, dot garden domain. You know, so I needed I needed a name, I needed a logo, and it has to be plant kind of stuff. So that I can have an excuse to buy a dog garden domain. And I thought about it, and something about my knowledge, my brain. cerebral stuff like that. Then Kate garden. You have tyrians. So it's just, it's just, it's just a combination of the two tours, hirable? terrarium and stuff like that. Yeah. And then I may go on this present. This one. Does it get bigger? I don't think so. But this is so it's like a terrarium. It's open on the bottom and has all the brainy kind of detail but it's a plant. So yeah, I wanted to do that. When I first started building it apart. So that's how I that's how I got the name.\n\nUnknown Speaker  50:05  \nIt's awesome. And I love the logo that you have. And I might call upon you to do future adventure that science so that that'd be great. Yeah. Well, at this point, I think we have a little over so I'm going to stop the recording. But thank you very much mark for the talk. And I think we all have a lot to take away from this.\n\n\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/9PXYLuvnSMwMPVwh.html","relUrl":"notes/9PXYLuvnSMwMPVwh.html"},{"doc":"A Day in Dendron","title":"A Day in Dendron","hpath":"dendron.community.greenhouse.2021-07-23-using-dendron-with-20k-notes","content":"## Summary\n\nIn this talk, Kevin, Dendron founder, will go over how he uses Dendron to manage his personal knowledge base of +20K notes. \n\n- Date: 2021.07.23\n- Time: 7:30AM PST\n- Location: [Zoom](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/89174320990?pwd=aTRrNzRvK3NhK2VOQThRZC9aaXVEdz09)\n\n\n## Agenda\n- daily knowledge accretion using journal notes, scratch notes, and hierarchies\n- finding anything in seconds using lookup and search\n- vscode specific shortcuts and settings \n- various dendron optimizations \n- process for switching between windows, tabs, and workspaces\n- multi-desktop multi-vault setup\n\n## Resources\n- [Recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mXGyG9ikD4)\n- [Kevin's VSCode Keybindings](https://gist.github.com/kevinslin/8f17cbc9ba03c9137c41351e2cec6a7a)\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/fzHazEFWTpUVexmv.html","relUrl":"notes/fzHazEFWTpUVexmv.html"},{"doc":"Crop","title":"Crop","hpath":"dendron.community.crop","content":"\n\nEvery week, we post three issues in the [#feedback](https://discordapp.com/channels/717965437182410783/739186036495876126) channel.

A reporter asked Einstein about the value of some physical constant and Einstein replied that he didn't know. The reporter was flabbergasted but Einstein replied that he didn't want to bother memorizing something that he could easily look up.\n\nThis anecdote has always stuck with me because we live in a world where **everything** can be \"looked up.” In such a world, what does it even mean to know something? And how do you apply that knowledge when there's just so much of it?\n\nIt was trying to answer these questions that led me to experiment and ultimately built my [own system for note-taking](https://www.kevinslin.com/notes/3dd58f62-fee5-4f93-b9f1-b0f0f59a9b64.html). Much like ML, the insight I had is that general knowledge, once cleaned up and structured, becomes orders of magnitude more useful.\n\nA year ago, I launched [Dendron](https://wiki.dendron.so/) to see if this system I developed would work for anyone else - now 3000 commits and 27,000 downloads later, I'm happy to say that it does. I get a thrill every time someone messages me about how they're using Dendron - whether it's planning out their next Dungeons and Dragons game or it's using Dendron as the central knowledge base for both work and home.\n\nWhat makes Dendron powerful is our ability to let users organize their information in a way that's most useful to them. Dendron takes many of the affordances developers are used to in code, like abstractions ([note references](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/f1af56bb-db27-47ae-8406-61a98de6c78c.html)), [refactoring](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/eea2b078-1acc-4071-a14e-18299fc28f47.html#refactor-hierarchy), and [symbol lookup](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/a7c3a810-28c8-4b47-96a6-8156b1524af3.html) and applying it to general knowledge.\n\nThese capabilities combined with our model of working over plaintext markdown and our open source license means that your knowledge is always yours, available instantly and in any way you want it.\n\nMoving forward, we will further expand on Dendron's capabilities to make it a full-blown **IDE for general knowledge.** To pursue this goal, we've raised [$2 million in seed capital](https://www.geekwire.com/2021/take-note-amazon-vets-raise-2m-dendron-tool-manage-large-amounts-information/) from [FUSE](https://fuse.vc/), [Founders’ Co-Op](https://www.founderscoop.com/), [First Rays](https://www.firstraysvc.com/), [Altair Capital](https://www.altair-cap.com/) and some incredible angels to build up our team. This money will ensure that issues and bugs can be addressed on time and take on more ambitious features.\n\nRest assured that nothing is changing about the way we do things - Dendron will remain open source and the client will always be local first and free. We plan to make money by charging teams and enterprises who want access to additional features like single sign-on, private registries and fine-grained access control.\n\nAs part of our growth from a project to a company, we are also publishing the [Dendron Handbook](https://handbook.dendron.so/). This is **heavily inspired** from the [Gitlab Handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/) and will document our mission, values, and roadmap as a company.\n\nFrom day one, the words of Vannevar Bush, originator of the [memex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex), has been our north star\n\n> \"We are overwhelmed with information and we don't have the tools to properly index and filter through it. [The development of these tools, which] will give society access to and command over the inherited knowledge of the ages [should] be the first objective of our scientist\" - Vannevar Bush, 1945\n\nOur goal is to help humans take **command over the inherited knowledge of the ages**. We welcome you to be part of our journey :)\n\n(and we are [[hiring|dendron.jobs]])\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/8d6bb6c6-f2b5-4fb4-a7f0-1930b528051f.html","relUrl":"notes/8d6bb6c6-f2b5-4fb4-a7f0-1930b528051f.html"},{"doc":"Dendron Alternatives","title":"Dendron Alternatives","hpath":"dendron.alternatives","content":"\nThe main difference between Dendron and almost every other note taking tool can be summed up below.

Like Dendron, Foam is built on top of VSCode and can benefit from the endless list of extensions existing in the ecosystem. Like Dendron, Foam is open source and local-first. \n\n## Dendron is built with hierarchy in mind.\n- It is possible for you to create notes in a hierarchical fashion in Foam by using dotted file names for your notes like you can do in Dendron.\n\n- However, the tooling for efficiently navigating through the hierarchy is missing in Foam.\n- Dendron's features are built so that navigating through your hierarchy comes naturally.\n  - Vital features such as [[lookup|dendron.topic.lookup]], [[schemas|dendron.topic.schema]], [[refactor hierarchy|dendron.topic.commands#refactor-hierarchy]] are just a few of the examples of existing features that makes Dendron stand out.\n  - You can find the full list of commands that you can use in Dendron for efficient hierarchical note taking [[here|dendron.topic.commands#hierarchies]].\n- With a [clearly defined approach](https://www.kevinslin.com/notes/3dd58f62-fee5-4f93-b9f1-b0f0f59a9b64.html) to note taking, Dendron can focus on building new features that we believe will enable more efficient note taking and knowledge management.\n\n## Dendron has better governance over core features.\n- Foam depends on a couple of extensions that provide a significant chunk of Foam's capabilities:\n  1. [Markdown All-in-one](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one) for various markdown editing conveniences.\n  2. [Markdown Notes](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kortina.vscode-markdown-notes) to bring features that can be found in various note taking tools such as Notational Velocity, nvalt, Bear, FSNotes, and Obsidian to VSCode.\n\n- While Dendron also makes use of third-party extensions like Foam does, the features that third-party extensions are providing are gradually being implemented into Dendron's core.\n- Unlike Foam, Dendron's existing third-party dependencies are updated and released by Dendron as a fork; This frees Dendron from the need for careful orchestration of development cycles of external tools.\n  - By doing so Dendron is able to focus attention to more important matters; feature implementation, enhancement, and troubleshooting are not at the mercy of third-party developers with Dendron.\n  - On top of having autonomy on our core feature sets, Dendron prioritizes interoperability between other similar tools and third party extensions so that users can extend Dendron's capabilities if they choose to do so.\n","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/p5fMTi-6zOyX1TwhL6dM0.html","relUrl":"notes/p5fMTi-6zOyX1TwhL6dM0.html"},{"doc":"Changelog","title":"Changelog","hpath":"root.changelog","content":"","url":"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/changelog.html","relUrl":"notes/changelog.html"}]
